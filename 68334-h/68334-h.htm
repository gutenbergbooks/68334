<h2 class="nobreak">THE SUSINESS OF SUSAN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan Parker</span> was twenty-six and nothing had ever
happened. To speak more accurately, plenty of things
had happened, but Man had never happened. As a
college girl and afterward, Susie had, to be sure, known
many men; but they had all passed by on the other
side. A young man of literary ambitions had once
directed a sonnet at Susie, but she was not without
critical judgment and she knew it for a weak effort.
This young man afterward became the sporting editor
of a great newspaper, and but for Susie’s fastidiousness
in the matter of sonnets she might have shared his
prosperity and fame. A professor of theology had once
sent her a sermon on the strength of a chance meeting
at a tea; but this, though encouraging, was hardly
what might be called a thrilling incident. Still, the
young professor had later been called to an important
church, and a little more enthusiasm for sermons on
Susie’s part might have changed the current of her life.</p>

<p>The brother of one of Susie’s Vassar classmates had
evinced a deep interest in Susie for a few months,
spending weekends at Poughkeepsie that might much
better have been devoted to working off his conditions
at New Haven; but the frail argosy of their young
affections had gone to smash with incredible ease and
swiftness over a careless assertion by Susie that, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
all, Harvard was the greatest American university.
All universities looked alike to her, and she had really
been no more interested in Harvard than in the academic
centers of Wyoming or Oklahoma. Now this
young gentleman was launched successfully as a mining
engineer and had passed Susan by for another of
his sister’s classmates, who was not nearly so interesting
or amusing as Susie.</p>

<p>Susie’s mother had died while she was in college,
and her father, in the year she was graduated. As he
had chosen a good name rather than great riches,
Susie had found it necessary to adjust herself to conditions,
which she did by taking the library course at
Witter Institute. In Syracuse, where Susan was born,
old friends of the family had said how fortunate it was
that her education made library work possible for her.
And, though this was true, Susie resented their tone
of condescension. In its various implications it dismissed
her from the world to which she had been
accustomed to another and very different sphere. It
meant that if she became an attendant in the Syracuse
Library she would assist at no more teas, and that
gradually she would be forgotten in the compilations
of lists of eligibles for such functions as illuminate the
social horizon of Syracuse.</p>

<p>Whereupon, being a duly accredited librarian, entitled
to consideration as such wherever book warehouses
exist, Susan decided to try her luck in a strange
land, where hours from nine to six would be less heart-breaking
than in a town where every one would say
how brave Susie was, or how shameful it was that her
father had not at least kept up his life insurance.</p>

<p>The archives of Denver, Omaha and Indianapolis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
beckoned. She chose Indianapolis as being nearer the
ocean.</p>

<p>In her changes of status and habitat the thing that
hurt Susan most was the fact that the transition fixed
her, apparently for all time, among the Susans. She
had been named Susan for an aunt with money, but
the money had gone to foreign missions when Susie
was six. In college she had always been Susie to
those who did not call her Miss Parker. Her introduction
to the library in the Hoosier capital was, of
course, as Miss Parker; but she saw Miss Susan looming
darkly ahead of her. She visualized herself down
the gray vistas, preyed upon daily by harassed women
in search of easy catercorners to club papers, who
would ask at the counter for Miss Susan. And she
resented, with all the strength of her healthy young
soul, the thought of being Miss Susan.</p>

<p>Just why Sue and Susie express various shades of
character and personal atmosphere not hinted in the
least by Susan pertains to the psychology of names,
and is not for this writing. Susie was a small human
package with a great deal of yellow hair, big blue eyes,
an absurdly small mouth and a determined little
nose. As a child and throughout her college years
she had been frolicsome and prankish. Her intimates
had rejected Sue as an inappropriate diminutive for
her. Sue and Susie are not interchangeable. Sue
may be applied to tall, dark girls; but no one can
imagine a Susie as tall or dark. In college the girls
had by unanimous consent called her Susie, with an
affectionate lingering upon the second syllable and a
prolongation of the “e.”</p>

<p>To get exactly the right effect, one should first bite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
into a tart gooseberry. In her corridor at Vassar it
had been no uncommon thing to speak of her affectionately
as Susie the Goosie. Another term of endearment
she evoked was Susie the Syracuse Goosie, usually
when she was in disgrace with the powers.</p>

<p>And Susie was the least bit spoiled. She had liked
these plays upon her name. Her sayings and doings
were much quoted and described in those good old
days before she became Miss Susan Parker on a public
library payroll. An admiring classmate had suggested
the writing of a book to be called the Susiness of Susie.
And Susie was funny—every one admitted that she
was. She left behind her at college a reputation as a
past mistress of the unexpected, and a graceful skater
over the thin ice of academic delinquency. She had
liked the admiration of her classmates and had more
or less consciously played for it. She did not mind
so much being small when it was so clear that her
compact figure contributed so considerably to her general
Susiness.</p>

<p>And the manner of the way in which Susan became
Susie again fell in this wise:</p>

<p>Last summer the newest certain rich man in Indianapolis,
having builded himself a house so large that
his wife took the children and went abroad to be comfortable,
fell under the fascinations of a book agent,
who equipped his library with four thousand of the
books that are books. The capitalist really meant to
read them when he got time—if he ever did; and, in
order that he might the more readily avail himself of
his library when leisure offered, he acted upon the
agent’s hint that it should be scientifically catalogued.
The public librarian had suggested Miss Parker as a
competent person for the task; and Logan, the owner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
of the unread books, having been pleased with the
candidate’s appearance, had suggested that she live in
the house while doing the work, to be company for
his wife’s aunt, who was marooned there during Mrs.
Logan’s absence. Logan thereupon went to Alaska to
look at an investment. The aunt proved agreeable
and the big Logan house was, of course, a much pleasanter
place than Susan’s boarding house, where she
had been annoyed by the efforts of one or two young
gentlemen to flirt with her. Though her isolation
emphasized the passing of her Susiness, she was reasonably
happy, and set up her typewriter among the
new books to do the cataloguing. In the long, eventless
evenings she read to the aunt or cut leaves, and
felt the years of her Susihood receding.</p>

<p>And it was not until the very last week of her stay
in the Logan house that Miss Susan Parker experienced
a recrudescence of her Susiness.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Late one afternoon, midway of September, Susie,
who had just returned from a stroll, stood on the Logan
portico watching the motors flit past, and thinking a
little mournfully that in a few days she must go back
to her boarding house and her place behind the library
counter. It was then that she observed Mr. Webster
G. Burgess on his doorstep adjoining, viewing the
urban landscape reflectively. He was hatless and in
his hand he held a bit of yellow paper that resembled
a telegram. Noting Susie’s presence on the Logan
veranda, he crossed the lawn in her direction. She
knew from a personal item in the afternoon paper that
Mr. Burgess had returned from his vacation, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Mrs. Burgess was to follow at once, accompanied by
her younger sister, Miss Wilkinson; and that she was
to entertain immediately Mr. Brown Pendleton, a
wealthy young American explorer and archæologist,
who was coming to Indiana to deliver the dedicatory
address at the opening of the new Historical Museum
at the state university. Mrs. Burgess always entertained
all the distinguished people who visited Indianapolis,
and it had occurred to Susan that by the
exercise of ordinary vigilance she might catch a glimpse
of Brown Pendleton during his stay at the house next
door. Webster Burgess was a banker who had inherited
his bank, and he had always found life rather
pleasant going. His wife diverted him a good deal,
and the fact that she played at being a highbrow
amused him almost more than anything else. He had
kept his figure, and at forty-two was still able to dance
without fear of apoplexy. He chose his haberdashery
with taste, and sometimes he sent flowers to ladies
without inclosing his wife’s card; but his wife said this
was temperamental, which was a very good name for it.</p>

<p>Susie, holding her ground as Burgess advanced, composedly
patted the head of one of the bronze lions that
guarded the entrance to the Logan doors.</p>

<p>“Good evening! It’s mighty nice to see you back
again,” said Burgess, smiling.</p>

<p>It was at this instant that Susan, hearing the god
of adventure sounding the call to arms, became Susie
again.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to see you, Mr. Burgess,” she replied;
and ceasing to fondle the bronze lion’s left ear
she gave the banker her hand. “Summer is hanging
on,” observed Susie; “it’s quite warm this evening.”</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, and most of our neighbors seem to
be staying away late; but I’m glad you’re back.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>Susie was glad he was back. Her superficial knowledge
of Mr. Webster Burgess bore wholly upon his
standing as a banker. In the year she had spent in
his ancestral city she had never heard anything to
justify a suspicion that he was a gentleman given to
flirtations with strange young women. There was
something quite cozy and neighborly in his fashion of
addressing her. His attitude seemed paternal rather
than otherwise. He undoubtedly mistook her for a
member of the Logan household. It crossed her mind
that he probably knew little of the Logan family, who
had occupied the new house only to leave it; but she
knew there were several Logan girls, for she was occupying
the room designed for one of them.</p>

<p>“This is what I call downright good luck!” Burgess
continued, glancing at his watch. “Mrs. Burgess
reaches town at six, with her sister—and Brown Pendleton,
the explorer, and so on. We met him at Little
Boar’s Head, and you know how Mrs. Burgess is—she
wanted to be sure he saw this town right. A mighty
interesting chap—his father left him a small mint,
and he spends his income digging. He’s dug up about
all the Egyptians, Babylonians and Ninevites. He’s
coming out to make a speech—thinks of prying into
the mound-builders; though I don’t see why any one
should. Do you?”</p>

<p>“On the whole I think the idea rather tickles me,”
said Susie. “I always thought it would be fun to try
a lid-lifter on the dead past.”</p>

<p>Mr. Burgess took note of her anew and chuckled.</p>

<p>“Open up kings like sardines! I like your way of
putting it.”</p>

<p>“A few canned kings for domestic consumption,”
added Susie, thinking that he was very easy to talk to.
The fact that he did not know her from a daughter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the royal house of Rameses made not the slightest difference
now that the adventurous spirit of the old
Susie days possessed her.</p>

<p>Mr. Burgess was scrutinizing the telegram again.</p>

<p>“I want you to dine with us this evening—as a
special favor, you know. It’s rather sudden, but Mrs.
Burgess has a sudden way of doing things. Just as I
left my office I got this wire ordering me to produce
the most presentable girl I could find for dinner. Pendleton
hates big functions, but I nailed Billy Merrill
at the club on my way up, according to instructions—you
can always get Billy; but I went through the telephone
book without finding any unattached woman of
suitable age I would dare take a shot at, knowing my
wife’s prejudices. And then I looked over here and
saw you.”</p>

<p>His manner conveyed, with the utmost circumspection,
the idea that seeing her had brightened the world
considerably.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Burgess,” replied Susie, without the
slightest hesitation or qualm. “At seven, did you
say?”</p>

<p>“Seven-thirty we’d better say. There’s my machine
and I’ve got to go to the station to meet them.”</p>

<p>As Susan, the thing would have been impossible; as
Susie, it seemed the most natural thing in the world.
Burgess was backing down the steps. Every instant
reduced the possibility of retreat; but the fact was, that
she exulted in her sin. She was an impostor and she rejoiced
shamelessly in being an impostor. And yet it
did not seem altogether square to accept Mr. Burgess’s
invitation to dinner when it would undoubtedly involve
him in difficulties with his wife, whom she had
never seen in her life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Burgess paused and wheeled round abruptly.</p>

<p>Her Susiness experienced a shock—the incident, in
her hasty conjecture, was already closed—for he said:</p>

<p>“By-the-way, what is your name anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Susie,” she said, lifting her chin Susily.</p>

<p>Mr. Burgess laughed, as though it were perfectly
obvious that she was a Susie—as though any one at a
glance ought to know that this young person in the
white flannel skirt and blue shirt-waist was a Susie,
ordained to be so called from the very first hour of
creation.</p>

<p>“Just for fun, what’s the rest of it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Parker, please. I’m not even a poor relation of
the Logans.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose you were; quite and distinctly
not!” he declared as though the Logans were wholly
obnoxious. “I never saw you before in my life—did
I?”</p>

<p>“Never,” said Susie, giving him the benefit of her
blue eyes.</p>

<p>Burgess rubbed his ear reflectively.</p>

<p>“I think I’m in for a row,” he remarked in an agreeable
tone, as though rows of the sort he had in mind
were not distasteful to him.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Susie with an air of making concessions,
“if you really didn’t mean to ask me to dinner,
or have changed your mind now that you find I’m
a stranger and a person your wife would never invite
to her house, we’ll call the party off.”</p>

<p>“Heavens, no! You can’t send regrets to a dinner
at the last minute. And if you don’t show up I’m
going to be in mighty bad. You see——” He gazed
at Susie with the keen scrutiny he reserved for customers
when they asked to have their lines of credit extended,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and he carefully weighed the moral risk. “We seem to
be on amazingly intimate terms, considering our short
acquaintance. There’s something about you that inspires
confidence.”</p>

<p>“I’m much uplifted by this tribute,” said Susie with
a Susesque touch that escaped her so naturally, so
easily, that she marveled at herself.</p>

<p>Burgess smiled broadly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” he remarked, “that you don’t quite
fill the bill; but you’ll do—you’ve got to do!”</p>

<p>He handed her the telegram he had retained in his
hand and watched her face as she read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>P. is greatly taken with Floy, and we must
give her every chance. Pick up an uninteresting
young man and one of the least attractive
of the older girls for dinner tonight.
This is important Make no mistake.</p>
</div>

<p>“Those are my instructions. Can you ever forgive
me?”</p>

<p>“With my hair brushed straight back, they say I’m
quite homely,” observed Susie sighing.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t do my worst,” said the banker, “where
Nature has been so generous.”</p>

<p>“It seems,” observed Susie meditatively, “that I’m
your deliberate choice as a foil for your sister-in-law,
by sheer force of my unattractiveness.”</p>

<p>“I’m slightly nearsighted,” replied the banker. “It’s
a frightful handicap.”</p>

<p>“I can see that glasses would be unbecoming to you.”</p>

<p>“The matter of eyes,” said the banker, stroking a
lion, “is not one I should trust myself to discuss with
you. Do you mind telling me what you’re doing here?”</p>

<p>“Cutting the leaves in the books and making a card
catalogue. I use the typewriter with a dexterity that
has been admired.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“A person of education, clearly.”</p>

<p>“French and German were required by my college;
and I speak English with only a slight Onondaga
accent, as you observe.”</p>

<p>Her essential Susiness seemed to be communicating
itself to the banker. His chauffeur loosened a raucous
blast of the horn warningly.</p>

<p>“I fear your time is wasted. The Logans will never
read those books. It’s possible that the hand of Fate
guided me across the lawn to deliver you from the
lions. The thought pleases me. To continue our confidences,
I will say that, noble woman though my wife
is, her sister has at times annoyed me. And when I
left Little Boar’s Head I saw that Pendleton suspected
that we were trying to kidnap him.”</p>

<p>“And I take it that the natural fellow-feeling of man
for man would mitigate your sorrow if the gentleman
whom your wife is carrying home in a birdcage should
not, in fact, become your brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“It would be indelicate for me to go so far as that;
but Floy has always had a snippy way with me. I
should like to see her have to work for the prize.”</p>

<p>“My dinner frock is three years old, but I’ll see
what I can do to become a natural hazard. You’d
better move upon the station—the blasts of that horn
are not soothing to the nerves.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Brown Pendleton, Ph.D., L.H.D., F.R.G.S., frowned
as he adjusted his white tie before the mirror of the
Burgesses’ best guest-room. He was a vigorous,
healthy American of thirty, quite capable of taking
care of himself; and yet he had been dragged submissively
across the continent by a lady who was animated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
by an ambition to marry him to her sister,
toward whom his feelings, in the most minute self-analysis,
were only those of polite indifference. And
the mound-builders, now that he thought of it, were
rather tame after Egypt and Babylon. As he surveyed
his tanned face above his snowy shirt bosom he
wished that he had never consented to deliver the
address at the opening of the new Historical Museum
at Indiana University, which was the ostensible
reason for this Western flight. As for Miss Floy Wilkinson,
she was a perfectly conventional person, who
had—not to be more explicit—arrived at a time of
life when people say of a girl that she is holding her
own well. And she was. She was indubitably handsome,
but not exciting. She was the sort of girl who
makes an ideal house guest, and she had walked down
church aisles ahead of one after the other of her old
school friends all the way from Duluth to Bangor.
Mrs. Burgess had become anxious as to Floy’s future,
and in convoying Pendleton to Indianapolis and planting
him in her best guest-chamber she was playing her
cards with desperation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess ran upstairs to dress after a hasty
cross-examination of the cook, to make sure her telegraphic
order for dinner had been understood, and
found her husband shaking himself into his dress coat.</p>

<p>She presented her back to be unhooked and talked
on in a way she had.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you got Grace Whiting or Minnie
Rideout? And, of course, you couldn’t have failed on
Billy Merrill. I think Grace and Billy are showing
signs, at last, of being interested in each other. You
can’t tell what may have happened during the summer.
But if Pendleton should fail—well, Billy isn’t so dull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
as people think; and Floy doesn’t mind his clumsiness
so much as she did. Did you say you got Minnie?”</p>

<p>Mr. Burgess, absorbed in a particularly stubborn
hook, was silent. Mrs. Burgess was afraid to urge
conversation upon him lest he should throw up the
job, and Floy was monopolizing the only available
maid. When a sigh advertised his triumph over the
last hook she caught him as he was moving toward
the door.</p>

<p>“Did you say Minnie was coming, Web?”</p>

<p>“No, Gertie—no. You didn’t say anything about
Minnie in your telegram; you said to get a girl.”</p>

<p>“Why, Web, you know that meant Grace Whiting
or Minnie Rideout; they are my old standbys.”</p>

<p>“Well, Grace has gone somewhere to bury her uncle,
and Minnie is motoring through the Blue Grass. It
was pretty thin picking, but I did the best I could.”</p>

<p>His tone and manner left much to be desired. His
wife’s trunk was being unstrapped in the hall outside
and there was no time for parleying.</p>

<p>“Whom did you get, then? Not——”</p>

<p>“I got Susie,” said Burgess, shooting his cuffs.</p>

<p>“Susie?”</p>

<p>“Susie!” he repeated with falling inflection.</p>

<p>“What Susie?”</p>

<p>“Well, Gertie, to be quite frank, I’ll be hanged if I
know. I haven’t the slightest, not the remotest, idea.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Web?—if you know!”</p>

<p>The clock on the stairs below was chiming half past
six. Burgess grinned; it was not often he had a chance
like this. In social affairs it was she who did the
befuddling.</p>

<p>“I mean to say that, though her name is Susie, it’s
rather more than a proper name; it’s also a common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
noun, and chock-full of suggestions—pleasant ones, on
the whole.” She was trying to free herself of her
gown, and one of the hooks caught so that he had to
extricate her. Half angry, half alarmed, she seized him
by his lapels, for fear he might escape before she had
put an end to his foolishness. “She said her name
was Parker; but I rather question it. She looks like a
Susie, but the Parker is something of a misfit. For
myself, I prefer to cut out the Parker.”</p>

<p>“Web Burgess, tell me just what you have been up
to! Don’t I know this person?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. And I don’t hesitate to say that it’s
a loss on both sides.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that at this serious crisis
in all our lives, when there’s so much at stake, you’ve
asked a girl to dinner in this house that we don’t know?
After all my work—after——”</p>

<p>“After your telegram, which I interpreted literally
to mean that I was to land a girl for dinner who would
serve merely to emphasize Floy’s haughty grandeur,
I did the best I could. Grace and Minnie were not
available; Susie was. So Susie is coming.”</p>

<p>“Web, we’ve been married ten years and I have
never had any reason to suspect you or even complain
of you; but if you think you can pick up some strange
girl among your admirations and bring her to my table
I shall resent it; I shall not pass it lightly by!” she
ended tragically.</p>

<p>Burgess walked to the window, drew back the curtain
and peered across at the Logan house.</p>

<p>“I suspect that Susie’s getting into her fighting
clothes. You needn’t be afraid of Susie. Susie’s entirely
respectable. And, as for my relations with Susie,
she hadn’t gladdened my sight an hour ago. You’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
better let me send Nora to help you. It would be
awkward for you not to be down when Susie comes.”</p>

<p>He hummed inanely, “When Susie comes! When
Susie comes!” and closed the door upon her indignation.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>At seven-twenty-nine Susie eluded the vigilance of
the wondering lions and ran up the Burgess steps.</p>

<p>Burgess met her in the hall, where she stepped out
of her wrap and stood forth rather taller than he
remembered her, by reason of her high-heeled slippers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess, proud of her reputation for meeting
emergencies, did not wait for her guest to be presented.
Her quick scrutiny discovered nothing alarming in this
young person. With a quick eye she appraised the
three-year-old gown, correctly placed its vintage and
said:</p>

<p>“So nice that you could come.”</p>

<p>Pendleton, who knew a great many girls in different
parts of the world, saw nothing disquieting in this
Miss Parker. She was merely another girl. Billy
Merrill, who was forty, wondered whether there would
be champagne or only sauterne besides the cocktail.
He had never heard of Pendleton, any more than he
had heard of Miss Parker, and he was speculating as
to whether he had ever really been in love with Floy
Wilkinson, and whether he should venture to propose
to her again just after Christmas. Proposing to Floy
was a habit with Billy.</p>

<p>At the round table the forks for the caviar had been
overlooked, and this gave the dinner a bad start.
Mrs. Burgess was annoyed, and to cover her annoyance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
she related an anecdote, at which the guest of
honor only smiled wanly. He did not seem happy.
He barely tasted his soup, and when Burgess addressed
a question to him directly Pendleton did not hear it
until it had been repeated. Things were not going
well. Then Billy Merrill asked Pendleton if he was
related to some Pendletons he knew in St Louis.
Almost every one knew that Brown Pendleton belonged
to an old Rhode Island family—and Merrill
should have known it. Mrs. Burgess was enraged by
the fleeting grin she detected on her husband’s face.
Web was always so unsympathetic. Burgess was conversing
tranquilly with Susie; he never grasped the
idea that his wife gave small dinners to encourage general
conversation. And this strange girl would not
contribute to the conversation; she seemed to be making
curious remarks to Webster in a kind of baby talk
that made him choke with mirth. “An underbred,
uncultivated person!” thought Mrs. Burgess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess decided that it would not be amiss to
take soundings in the unknown’s past and immediate
present.</p>

<p>“You don’t usually come back to town so early, do
you, Miss Parker?” she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>“No; but Newport was rather slow this year—so
many of the houses weren’t open.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess and her sister exchanged a glance of
startled surprise. Brown Pendleton’s thoughts came
back from Babylon. Merrill looked at Miss Parker
with open-eyed admiration.</p>

<p>“Dear old Newport!” Pendleton remarked with feeling.
“It has rather lost tone. I’m not surprised that
you didn’t care for it.”</p>

<p>He examined Susie with deliberation.</p>

<p>“The Niedlingers and the Parquetries didn’t show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
up at all; and the Ossingtons are said to have cut it
out for good,” observed Susie.</p>

<p>“Yes; I saw Fred Ossington in London in the spring,
and he said he had enough. Nice chap, Fred.”</p>

<p>“Too bad he had to give up polo,” said Susie, advancing
her pickets daringly; “but I fancy his arm will
never be fit again.”</p>

<p>“He’s going in for balloons. Can you believe it?
Amusing fellow! Said he preferred falling on the earth
to having it fall on him. And, besides, a balloon
couldn’t kick when it had him down.”</p>

<p>The conversation was picking up, and quite clearly
it was the unknown who was giving it momentum.
Fish had been disposed of satisfactorily and Mrs. Burgess
began to regain confidence. The unknown must
be checked. It would not do for the girl to go further
with this light, casual discussion, conveying as she did
all sorts of implications of knowledge of the great in
lofty places. The vintage of the dinner gown testified
unimpeachably against her having any real knowledge
of Newport, a place where Mrs. Burgess had once
spent a day at a hotel. Mrs. Burgess resolved to
squelch the impostor. Such presumption should not
go unrebuked even at one’s own table. Pendleton
was now discussing aviation with this impertinent
Susie, who brought to the subject the same light
touch of apparent sophistication she had employed
in speaking of Newport and polo. She asked him if
he had read an account of a new steering device for
dirigibles; she thought she had seen it in <i>L’Illustration</i>.
Pendleton was interested, and scribbled the approximate
date of the journal on the back of his namecard.</p>

<p>“I suppose you came back ahead of your family,
Miss Parker? I really don’t know who’s in town.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m quite alone, Mrs. Burgess. You see,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and Susie tilted her head Susily and spoke directly to
Mrs. Burgess, “one never really knows anything about
one’s neighbors.”</p>

<p>“Ah—you live close by?” asked Pendleton.</p>

<p>Susie answered with an imperceptible movement of
the head:</p>

<p>“Oh, just next door, you know.”</p>

<p>“How charming! At the sign of the lions? I noticed
them as we came up. I must have another look
at them. Rather good, as near as I could make out.”</p>

<p>“They are rather nice, I think,” said Susie as one
who would not boast of her possessions. “Ernestenoff
did them—one of Barye’s pupils.”</p>

<p>Burgess wondered how far she would go. Merrill’s
face wore the look of a man who is dying of worry. He
had lived in town all his life, and it was inconceivable
that this was one of Logan’s daughters. He had forgotten
the girl’s name, and he resolved to pay attention
in future when people were introduced.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess was too far at sea herself to bother
with his perplexities. Thoroughly alarmed, she threw
the conversation back three thousand years and shifted
its playground from the Wabash Valley to the left
bank of the Euphrates, confident that the temerarious
person with the yellow hair and blue eyes would be
dislodged.</p>

<p>“When you first began your excavations in Assyria,
Mr. Pendleton, I suppose you didn’t realize how important
your work would be to the world.”</p>

<p>The table listened. Merrill groped for light. This
Pendleton was, then, a digger among ancient ruins!
Miss Wilkinson’s eyes were ready to meet Pendleton’s
responsively and sympathetically: her interest in archæology
was recent and superficial, but this was only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
more reason for yielding ungrudging admiration to the
eminent digger. Pendleton did not reply at once
to Mrs. Burgess’s question, and instead of appearing
pleased by its ingratiating flattery he frowned and
played with his wine-glass nervously. When he broke
the silence it was to say in a hard tone that was wholly
unlike his usual manner of speech:</p>

<p>“I’m not at all sure that it has been of importance;
I’m inclined to think I wasted five years on those jobs.”</p>

<p>His depression was undeniable and he made no effort
to conceal it. And Mrs. Burgess was angry to find
that she had clumsily touched the wrong chord, and
one that seemed to be vibrating endlessly. She had
always flattered herself that she had mastered the delicate
art of drawing out highbrows. Scores of distinguished
visitors to the Hoosier capital had gone
forth to publish her charm and wit; and this was the
first cloud that had ever rested above a dinner table
where a Chinese prince had been made to feel at home,
and whence poets, bishops, novelists, scientists and
statesmen had departed radiant. She had not only
struck the wrong note but one that boomed monotonously
down the long corridors of time.</p>

<p>Burgess mildly sought to inject a needleful of bromide
into the situation.</p>

<p>“You’re probably not a good judge of that, Mr.
Pendleton. The world has already set its seal of
approval upon your investigations.”</p>

<p>“It’s not the world’s praise we want,” said Pendleton;
“it’s the praise of the men who know.”</p>

<p>This was not tactful; it apparently brushed aside his
host’s approval as negligible. Miss Wilkinson flashed
Pendleton one of her brilliant smiles, remarking:</p>

<p>“You are altogether too modest, Mr. Pendleton.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Every one says that your ‘Brickyards of Nebuchadnezzar’
is the last word on that subject.”</p>

<p>And then a chill seized Mrs. Burgess. The yellow-haired,
blue-eyed unknown moved her head slightly to
one side, bit an almond in two with neatness, and said:</p>

<p>“If I were you, Mr. Pendleton, I shouldn’t let a
faker like Geisendanner annoy me.”</p>

<p>Susie regarded the remaining half of the almond
indifferently and then ate it musingly. At the mention
of Geisendanner Pendleton flushed, and his head
lifted as though he heard trumpets calling to action.
Then he bent toward Susie. The salad had just been
removed. Mrs. Burgess beat the table with her fingers
and awaited the earthquake. Her only relief at the
moment was in the consciousness that her husband,
from the look of his face, at last realized the heinousness
of his conduct in bringing just any little whipper-snapper
to her table. And Susie seemed to be the
only member of the company who was wholly tranquil.
Mrs. Burgess wondered whether she could be more
than twenty, so complete had been the reinvestiture of
the girl in the robes of her Susiness. She had spoken
of Geisendanner as though he lived round the corner
and were a person that every one with any sort of
decent bringing up knew or should know. The effect
of the name upon Pendleton was not pleasant to see,
and Mrs. Burgess shuddered. After the first shock of
surprise he seemed wonderfully subdued. Clearly this
Geisendanner was an enemy or a man he feared. The
eminent Babylonian met Susie’s eyes apprehensively.
He said in a low tone of dejection:</p>

<p>“So you know then?” As though of course she did,
and that a dark understanding had thus been established
by their common knowledge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Susie nodded.</p>

<p>“Rather absurd, on the whole, when you consider——”</p>

<p>Her plate was being changed and she drew back
during the interruption. Pendleton shook his head
impatiently at the delay.</p>

<p>“Absurd! How absurd? If it’s absurd to have the
results of years of hard work chucked into the rubbish
heap, then——”</p>

<p>“But no!” Susie felt for her fork without breaking
the contact of their eyes. She was smiling as though
quite the mistress of the occasion and waiting merely
to prolong the agony of the sufferers about her. She
was not insensible to their sufferings; it was pleasant
rather than otherwise to inflict torture. Still her attitude
toward the distressed scientist was kindly—but
she would make him wait. Her bearing toward Pendleton
at the moment was slightly maternal. It was
only a matter of bricks anyhow; and trifles like the
chronological arrangement of bricks, where, one toppling,
all went down, were not only to the young person’s
liking but quite within the range of her powers of
manipulation. “As I remember,” she continued, “Geisendanner
first attacked the results of the Deutsche
Orientgesellschaft; but, of course, that was disposed of.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Pendleton eagerly; “Auchengloss did
that.”</p>

<p>It seemed preposterous that the small mouth of this
young person could utter such names at all, much less
with an air of familiarity, as though they were the
names of streets or of articles of commerce.</p>

<p>“It was Glosbrenner, however, who paved the way
for you by disposing of Geisendanner—absolutely.”</p>

<p>“The excavations they made in their absurd search<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
for treasure in the ruins confused everything; but Glosbrenner’s
exposé was lost—burnt up in a printing-office
fire in Berlin. There’s not an assertion in my ‘Brickyards
of Nebuchadnezzar’ that isn’t weakened by that
bronze-gate rubbish, for Geisendanner was a scholar of
some reputation. After the failure of his hidden-treasure
scheme he faked his book on the Bronze Gates
of Babylon as a pot boiler, and died leaving it behind
him—one of the most plausible frauds ever perpetrated.
They went in on top of my excavations of the
brickyard—thought because I was an American I
must have been looking for gold images. Glosbrenner
was an American student; and seeing that his fellow-adventurer’s
book was taken seriously he wrote his
exposé, swore to it before the American consul at
Berlin and then started for Tibet to sell an automobile
to the Grand Lama—and never came back.”</p>

<p>Pendleton’s depression had increased; gloom settled
upon the company—or upon all but this demure young
skeleton at the feast, who had thus outrageously
brought to the table the one topic of all topics in the
world that was the most ungrateful to the man Mrs.
Burgess most particularly wished to please. She sought
without avail to break in upon a dialogue that excluded
the rest of the company as completely as though they
were in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I was just reading that thing in the Seven Seas’
Review; but you can see that the reviewer swallowed
Geisendanner whole. He takes your brickyards away
from Nebuchadnezzar and gives them to Nabopolassar,
which seems v-e-r-y c-a-r-e-l-e-s-s!”</p>

<p>This concluding phrase, drawled most Susesquely,
brought a laugh from Burgess, and Pendleton’s own
face relaxed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“They’re all flinging Geisendanner at me!” continued
Pendleton with renewed animation. “It’s humiliating
to find the English and Germans alike throwing
this impostor at my head. Those fellows began
their excavations secretly and without authority, in a
superstitious belief that they’d find gold images of
heathen gods and all manner of loot there. And it’s
hard luck that the confession of one of the conspirators
is lost forever and the man himself dead.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is most unfortunate!” mourned Mrs.
Burgess, anxious to pour balm upon his wounds.</p>

<p>“It’s curious, however, Mr. Pendleton,” said Susie
casually, “that I happen to know of the existence of
a copy of that Glosbrenner pamphlet.”</p>

<p>“A copy—— You mustn’t chaff me about that!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Susie; “it’s really quite the funniest
thing that ever happened.”</p>

<p>“This seems to be an important matter, Miss Parker.
You have no right to play upon Mr. Pendleton’s credulity,
his hopes!” said Mrs. Burgess icily.</p>

<p>“Nothing like that, Mrs. Burgess!” chirruped Susie.
“I can tell Mr. Pendleton exactly where one copy of
that pamphlet, and probably the only one in the world,
may be found. And a small investment in a night
message to Poughkeepsie will verify what I say. There
is a copy of that pamphlet at Vassar College that was
picked up in Berlin by one of the professors, who gave
it to the library. It had a grayish cover and looked
like a thesis for a doctorate—that sort of thing. It was
a little burned on the edges, and that was one reason
why it caught my eye one day when I was poking
about looking for something among a lot of German
treatises with the most amusing long titles. And it
was a perfectly dee-li-cious story—how they dug and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
mixed up those dynasties there; and then one of them
wrote a book about it, just for the money he could
get out of it. It was all a fake, but they knew enough
to make it look like real goods. It was a kind of
Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer joke, muddying
the water that way.”</p>

<p>The conjunction of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer
with Nebuchadnezzar caused even Merrill to laugh.</p>

<p>“I must wire tonight for a confirmation of this—or,
perhaps, if you are an alumna of the college you would
do it for me.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Susie, “they still remember me at
college. I was the limit!”</p>

<p>“If what you say is right,” Pendleton resumed, “I
can smash those Germans and make that Seven Seas’
reviewer eat his words! I really believe it would be
better for you to wire for me to the librarian for confirmation;
I’d rather not publish my anxiety to the
world. If you will do this I shall look upon it as the
greatest possible favor.”</p>

<p>“Delighted!” said Susie, crumpling her napkin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess showed signs of rising, but delayed a
moment.</p>

<p>“Miss Parker, you rather implied that there was
more than one reason why you happened to notice a
singed document in a strange language, bearing upon
a subject usually left to scientists and hardly within
the range of a young girl’s interests. Would you mind
enlightening us just a little further in the matter?”</p>

<p>“I thought it was so funny,” said Susie, smiling
upon them all, “because of my papa.”</p>

<p>“Your father?” gasped Mrs. Burgess.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Burgess. Anything about bricks always
seemed to me so amusing, because papa used to own
a brickyard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>A packet of newspaper clippings forwarded with
other mail for Pendleton did not add to the joy of
the Burgess breakfast table the next morning. The
archæologist murmured an apology and scanned the
cuttings with knit brows.</p>

<p>“How early,” he asked, “do you imagine Miss
Parker can have a confirmation of her impression
about that thing of Glosbrenner’s?”</p>

<p>“By noon, I should think,” answered Burgess.</p>

<p>The husband of Mrs. Burgess had passed a bad
night, and he was fully persuaded of the grievousness
of his most grievous sin. Never again, he had solemnly
sworn, would he attempt any such playfulness as had
wrought this catastrophe—never again would he expose
himself to the witchery of Susans prone to Susinesses!</p>

<p>“Unless I have corroboration of Miss Parker’s impression
before three o’clock I shall break my engagement
at the state university. With this article in the
Seven Seas’ Review lying on every college library
table, citing Geisendanner against me and discrediting
me as the discoverer of the brickyards of Nebuchadnezzar,
I shall never stand upon a platform again—and
I must withdraw my book. My reputation, in
other words, hangs upon a telegram,” concluded the
archæologist gloomily.</p>

<p>“It is inconceivable,” said Mrs. Burgess in a cheerful
tone that far from represented her true feelings, “that
Miss Parker would have spoken as she did if she hadn’t
been reasonably confident. Still it is always best to
be prepared for disappointments. I think you and
Floy had better take the motor for a run into the
country and forget the telegram until it arrives. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
dare say Miss Parker will send it over at once when
it comes.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, very much,” muttered Pendleton, not
highly elated at the thought of motoring with Miss
Wilkinson, whose efforts to enliven the breakfast table
by talking of things as far removed as possible from
the brickyards of oblivion had palled upon the wealthy
archæologist. He was an earnest chap, this Pendleton;
and the fact that his eligibility as a bachelor was
not, in certain eyes, greatly diminished by the failure
of his efforts to reëstablish the brick industries of
Babylon had not occurred to him. Floy and the Burgesses
bored him; but he was dazed by the threatened
collapse of his reputation. He declined his host’s invitation
to walk downtown; and in an equally absent-minded
fashion he refused an invitation to luncheon at
the University Club, to meet certain prominent
citizens. Whereupon, finding the air too tense for
his nerves, Burgess left for the bank.</p>

<p>Pendleton moved restlessly about the house, moodily
smoking, while the two women pecked at him occasionally
with conversation and then withdrew for
consultation. His legs seemed to be drawn to those
windows of the Burgess drawing room that looked
toward the Logans’. In a few minutes Pendleton
picked up his hat and stick and left the house, merely
saying to the maid he saw clearing up the dining room
that he was going for a walk. It is wholly possible
he meant to go for a walk quite alone, but at the
precise moment at which he reached the Logans’ iron
gates the Logan door opened suddenly, as though his
foot had released a spring, and Susie, in hat and coat,
surveyed the world from between the lions. Mrs.
Burgess and Floy, established in an upper window,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
saw Susie wave a hand to Brown Pendleton. For a
woman to wave her hand to a man she hasn’t known
twenty-four hours, particularly when he is wealthy
and otherwise distinguished, is the least bit open to
criticism. Susie did not escape criticism, but Susie
was happily unmindful of it. And it seemed that as
she fluttered down between the lions Pendleton grasped
her hand anxiously, as though fearing she meditated
flight; whereas nothing was further from Susie’s mind.</p>

<p>“Good news!” she cried. “They have just telephoned
me the answer from the telegraph office. I
think telephoned messages are so annoying; and, as
they take forever to send one out, I was just going to
the office to get it and send it up to you.”</p>

<p>“Then,” cried Pendleton with fervor, “you must let
me go with you. It’s a fine morning for a walk.”</p>

<p>At the telegraph office he read the message from
Susie’s friend, the librarian, which was official and
final. Whereupon Pendleton became a man of action.
To the professor of archæology at Vassar, whom he
knew, Pendleton wrote a long message referring to
the Seven Seas’ Review’s attack, and requesting that
the precious Glosbrenner confession be carefully guarded
until he could examine it personally at the college.
He wrote also a cable to the American consul at Berlin,
requesting that Geisendanner’s whole record be thoroughly
investigated.</p>

<p>“Why,” asked Susie, an awed witness of this reckless
expenditure for telegrams, “why don’t you ask the
State Department to back up your cable? They
must know you in Washington.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” ejaculated Pendleton, staring at Susie
as though frightened by her precociousness; “that’s
a bully idea! Phillips, the second assistant secretary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
is an old friend of mine, and he’ll tear up the earth for
me!”</p>

<p>As they strolled back uptown through the long
street, with its arching maples, they seemed altogether
like the oldest of friends. Pendleton did not appear to
mind at all, if he were conscious of the fact, that
Susie’s hat was not one of the new fall models, or that
her coat was not in the least smart. The strain was
over and he submitted himself in high good humor to
the Susiness of Susie. It was when they were passing
the Public Library that a mood of remorse seized her.
There was, she reflected, such a thing as carrying a
joke too far. She salved her conscience with the
reflection that if she had not yielded to the temptations
of her own Susiness and accepted Mr. Burgess’s invitation
she would not have been able to point this big,
earnest student to the particular alcove and shelf
where reposed the one copy in all the world of the
only document that would rout the critics of the Brickyards
of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>“That Geisendanner,” said Susie, rather more
soberly than he had yet heard her speak, “was, beyond
doubt, an awful liar and a great fraud; but I am a
much greater.”</p>

<p>“You!” exclaimed Pendleton, leaning for a moment
on his stick and staring at her.</p>

<p>“Even so! In the first place, I went to Mrs. Burgess’s
house for dinner last night through a mistake;
she had never seen or heard of me before, and Mr.
Burgess asked me merely because he had exhausted
the other possibilities and was desperate for some one
to fill a chink at his wife’s table. And the worst thing
I did was to make you think I knew all about Newport,
when I was never there in my life—and never saw any
of the people I mentioned. Everything I said I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
out of the newspapers. It was all just acting, and I
put it on a little more because I saw that Mrs. Burgess
and her sister didn’t like me; they didn’t think it was a
joke at all, my trying to be Susie again—just once more
in my life before I settled back to being called Miss
Susan forever. And the way I come to be living in
that fine house is simply that I’m borrowed from the
library for so much a week to catalogue the Logans’
library and push a paperknife through the books.
Now you see that Geisendanner isn’t in it with me for
downright wickedness and most s-h-o-c-k-i-n-g &#160; m-e-n-d-a-c-i-t-y!”</p>

<p>“But if you hadn’t done all those terrible things where
should I be?” demanded Pendleton. “But, before
dismissing your confession, would you mind telling me
just how you came to know—well, anything about me?”</p>

<p>“I’m almost afraid to go that far,” laughed Susie,
who, as a matter of fact, did not fear this big, good-natured
man at all.</p>

<p>“Tell me that,” encouraged Pendleton, “and we will
consider the confession closed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I’ll be happier to tell you, and then
the slate will be cleaned off a little bit anyhow. A
sample copy of the Seven Seas’ Review had strayed into
the house; and, in glancing over the list of book reviews
on the cover, I saw the Brickyards of Nebuchadnezzar
among the books noticed. I spent ten minutes reading
the review; and then I grabbed the Britannica—four
minutes more! And then in Who’s Who I saw that
you were a Newporter. It’s remarkable how educated
one can become in fifteen minutes! And, as I said
last night when Mrs. Burgess asked me how I came
to be interested in that sort of thing, my father ran a
brickyard!”</p>

<p>She was looking straight ahead, but the Babylonian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
expert saw that there were tears in her eyes, as though
called forth by the recollection of other and happier
times.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said gravely; “and now let us forget
all about this.”</p>

<p>They walked in silence for several minutes, not looking
at each other, until she said as they neared the
Burgess gate:</p>

<p>“After all, I’m the foolishest little Susie in the
world; and it’s a lot better for me to go back and be
Susan again, and not go to dinner parties where I’m
not expected.”</p>

<p>And what Pendleton seemed to say, though she was
not sure of it, was:</p>

<p>“Never!—not if I know myself!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Do you suppose,” Mrs. Burgess asked her sister
as they saw Susie tripping along beside Pendleton,
“that she has carried it through?”</p>

<p>“From Brown Pendleton’s looks,” said Floy, “I
should judge she had. But—it can’t be possible that
she’s coming in here again!”</p>

<p>Susie and Pendleton lingered at the gate for an instant,
in which he seemed to be talking earnestly.
Then together they entered; and in a moment Mrs.
Burgess and Floy faced them in the drawing room,
where Pendleton announced with undeniable relief
and satisfaction the good news from Poughkeepsie.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose you will make the address at the
university after all?” said Mrs. Burgess. “I find that
so many matters are pressing here that I shall have to
forego the pleasure of joining you; and Floy, of course,
will have to be excused also.”</p>

<p>“On the other hand,” said Pendleton with the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
engaging of smiles, “I must beg you not to abandon me.
Our party of last night was so perfect, and the results
of it so important to me, that I shall greatly regret
losing any member of it. I propose in my address
tonight to assert my claims to the discovery of the
brickyards of Nebuchadnezzar as against all the
assertions that contradict me in Geisendanner’s romantic
fiction about the bronze gates of Babylon. I should
like you all to be present, and I am going to beg you,
as a particular favor, Mrs. Burgess, to invite Miss
Parker to accompany us; for, without her helpful
hint as to the existence of that copy of Glosbrenner’s
confession, where, I should like to know, would I be?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess prided herself upon being able to meet
just such situations; and Susie was so demure—there
was about the child something so appealing and winning—that
Mrs. Burgess dipped her colors.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Pendleton. I’m sure that Mr.
Merrill will feel honored to be included. And I shall
be delighted to chaperon Miss Parker.”</p>

<p>“Miss Parker has agreed to help me run down some
obscure authorities on the mound-builders a little
later, and the trip will give her a chance to see what
they have in the university library. I can’t afford to
take any more chances with so much doubtful scientific
lore floating about.”</p>

<p>“I should think,” remarked Floy carelessly, “you
would find help of some kind almost essential in your
future work.”</p>

<p>“I think, myself,” said Susie with an uncontrollable
resurgence of her Susiness, “that it would save an
a-w-f-u-l &#160; l-o-t &#160; o-f &#160; t-r-o-u-b-l-e!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GIRL WITH THE RED FEATHER</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Webster G. Burgess</span>, president of the White
River National Bank, started slightly as he looked
up from the letter he had been reading and found Hill,
the Government detective, standing at the rail. Burgess
dropped the letter into a drawer and said briskly:</p>

<p>“Hello, Hill—looking for me?”</p>

<p>“No; not yet!”</p>

<p>This was an established form of salutation between
them and they both grinned. Burgess rose and leaned
against the rail, while the detective summarized his
latest counterfeiting adventure, which had to do with
a clew furnished by a bad bill that had several weeks
earlier got by one of the White River National tellers.
Hill had bagged the maker of the bill, and he had just
been satisfying himself that the teller would be ready
to testify the next day before the Federal grand jury.</p>

<p>Hill visited the bank frequently and Burgess knew
him well. The secret-service man was a veteran hunter
of offenders against the peace and dignity of the United
States, and, moreover, a capital story-teller. Burgess
often asked him into his private office for an hour’s
talk. He had once given a dinner in Hill’s honor,
inviting a select coterie of friends who knew a good
tale when they heard it and appreciated a shrewd,
resourceful man when they saw him.</p>

<p>The White River National was one of the largest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and strongest banks in the state, and Burgess was one
of the richest men in his native city of Indianapolis;
but these facts did not interfere with enjoyment of life
according to his lights, which were not unluminous.
Having been born on top, he was not without his
sympathetic interest in the unfortunates whose lot is
cast near the burnt bottom crust, and his generous
impulses sometimes betrayed him into doing things
that carping critics thought not wholly in keeping with
his responsibilities and station in life.</p>

<p>These further facts may be noted: Burgess was the
best-dressed man in Indianapolis—he always wore
a pink carnation; and on occasions when he motored
home for luncheon he changed his necktie—a fact that
did not go unremarked in the bank cages. He belonged
to hunting and fishing clubs in Canada, Maine and
North Carolina, and visited them at proper seasons.
There was a drop of adventurous blood in him that made
banking the least bit onerous at times; and when he
felt the need of air he disappeared to catch salmon or
tarpon, or to hunt grouse or moose. Before his father
had unkindly died and left him the bank and other
profitable embarrassments, he had been obsessed with
a passion for mixing in a South American revolution;
he had chafed when the Spanish War most deplorably
synchronized with the year of his marriage, and he
could think of no valid excuse for leaving the newly
kindled fire on his domestic altar to pose for Spanish
bullets. Twice since his marriage he had looked death
in the eye: once when he tumbled off a crag of the
Canadian Rockies—he was looking for a mountain
sheep; and again when he had been whistled down the
Virginia capes in a hurricane while yachting with a
Boston friend. Every one admitted that he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
good banker. If he got stung occasionally he did not
whimper; and every one knew that the White River
National could stand a good deal of stinging without
being obliged to hang crape on its front door.</p>

<p>Burgess had always felt that some day something
would happen to relieve the monotony of his existence
as the chief pilot of an institution which panics always
passed by on the other side. His wife cultivated
bishops, men of letters and highbrows generally;
and he was always stumbling over them in his home,
sometimes to his discomfiture. With that perversity
of human nature that makes us all pine for what is not,
he grew restive under the iron grip of convention and
felt that he would like to disappear—either into the
wilderness to play at being a savage, or into the shadowy
underworld to taste danger and share the experiences
of men who fight on the farther side of the barricade.</p>

<p>“You always seem to get ’em, Tom,” he remarked
to the detective in a familiar tone, bred of long acquaintance.
“Just knowing you has made a better man of
me. I’m bound to be good as long as you’re on the
job here; but don’t you ever get tired of the game?”</p>

<p>“Well, when you’re up against a real proposition
and are fencing with a man who’s as smart as you
are, or smarter, it’s some fun; but most of my cases
lately have been too tame. The sport isn’t what
it was when I started. All the crooks are catalogued
and photographed and dictagraphed these days; and
when you go after ’em you merely send in your card
and call a motor to joy-ride ’em to jail. It’s been a
long time since I was shot at—not since those bill-raisers
down in the Orange County hills soaked me
with buckshot. When they turn a man loose at
Leavenworth we know just about where he will bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
up and who’s at home to welcome him; and you can
usually calculate pretty well just when he will begin
manufacturing and floating the queer again.”</p>

<p>“You hang on to the petrified idea that once a crook,
always a crook—no patience with the eminent thinkers
who believe that ‘while the lamp holds out to burn,
the vilest sinner may return?’”</p>

<p>“Yep—return to jail! Well, I don’t say reform is
impossible; and I’ve let a few get by who did keep
straight. But it’s my business to watch and wait.
My best catches have been through luck as much as
good management—but don’t tell that on me; it would
spoil my reputation.”</p>

<p>He turned away, glanced across the room and swung
round into his former position with his arm resting on
the railing by Burgess’s desk. He continued talking
as before, but the banker saw that something had
interested him.</p>

<p>“See that young woman at the paying-teller’s
cage—halfway down the line—slight, trim, with a red
feather in her hat? Take a look.”</p>

<p>It was nearing the closing hour and long lines had
formed at all the windows. Burgess marked the red
feather without difficulty. As the women patrons of
the bank were accommodated at a window on the
farther side of the lobby he surmised that the young
woman was an office clerk on an errand for her employer.
She was neatly dressed; there was nothing in her appearance
to set her apart from a hundred office girls who
visited the bank daily and stood—just as this young
woman was standing—in the line of bookkeepers
and messengers.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the banker, “what about her?”</p>

<p>While looking at the girl the detective drew out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
telegram which he scanned and thrust back into his
pocket.</p>

<p>“Her mother runs a boarding house, and her father,
Julius Murdock, is a crook—an old yegg—a little
crippled by rheumatism now and out of the running.
But some of the naughty boys passing this way stop
there to rest. The place is—let me see—787 Vevay
Street.”</p>

<p>Burgess thoughtfully brushed a speck from his coat-sleeve,
then looked up indifferently.</p>

<p>“So? Hardly a fashionable neighborhood! Is that
what is called a fence?”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe the police did rip up the boarding
house a while back, but there was nothing doing.
Murdock’s able to make a front without visible means
of support—may have planted enough stuff to retire on.
He’s a sort of financial agent and scout for other crooks.
They’ve been in town only a few months. The old
man must feel pretty safe or he wouldn’t keep his money
in a bank. Nellie, out there, is Murdock’s daughter,
and she’s stenographer for the Brooks Lumber Company,
over near where they live. When I came in
she was at the receiving teller’s window with the lumber
company’s deposit. She’s probably waiting to draw
a little money now for her daddy. He’s one of the
few fellows in his line of business who never goes quite
broke. Just for fun, suppose you see what he has on
the books. If I’m wrong I’ll decline that cigar you’re
going to offer me from the box in your third left-hand
drawer.” The banker scribbled the name on a piece
of paper and sent a boy with it to the head bookkeeper.
“And I’d be amused to know how much Nellie is
drawing for Julius, too, while you’re about it,” added
the detective, who thereupon sat down in one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
visitors’ chairs inside the railing and became absorbed
in a newspaper.</p>

<p>Burgess strolled across the lobby, stopping to speak
to acquaintances waiting before the several windows—a
common practice of his at the busy hour. Just behind
the girl in the red hat stood a man he knew well; and
he shook hands and continued talking to him, keeping
pace with his friend’s progress toward the window.
The girl turned round once and looked at him. He had
a very good view of her face, and she was beyond question
a very pretty girl, with strikingly fine gray eyes
and the fresh color of youth. The banker’s friend
had been recounting an amusing story and Burgess
was aware that the girl turned her head slightly to
listen; he even caught a gleam of humor in her eyes.
She wore a plain jacket, a year or two out of fashion,
and the red feather in her cloth hat was not so crisp
as it appeared at a distance. She held a check in her
hand ready for presentation; her gloves showed signs of
wear. There was nothing to suggest that she was
other than a respectable young woman, and the
banker resented the detective’s implication that she
was the daughter of a crook and lived in a house that
harbored criminals. When she reached the window
Burgess, still talking to the man behind her, heard her
ask for ten-dollar bills.</p>

<p>She took the money and thrust it quickly into a
leathern reticule that swung from her arm. The
banker read the name of the Brooks Lumber Company
on the passbook she held in her hand.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Burgess as she stepped away from
the cage——“those are badly worn bills. Let me
exchange them for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you; but it doesn’t matter,” she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Without parleying he stepped to the exchange
window, which was free at the moment, and spoke to
one of the clerks. The girl opened her reticule and
when he turned round she handed him the bills. While
the clerk went for the new currency Burgess spoke of
the weather and remarked upon the menace of worn
bills to public health. They always meant to give
women fresh bills, he said; and he wished she would
insist upon having them. He was a master of the art of
being agreeable, and in his view it was nothing against
a woman that she had fine eyes and an engaging smile.
Her voice was pleasant to hear and her cheeks dimpled
charmingly when she smiled.</p>

<p>“All money looks good to me,” she said, thrusting
the new bills into her satchel; “but new money is
certainly nicer. It always seems like more!”</p>

<p>“But you ought to count that,” Burgess protested,
not averse to prolonging the conversation. “There’s
always the possibility of a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Well, if there is I’ll come back. You’d remember——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I’d remember,” replied Burgess with a
smile, and then he added hastily: “In a bank it’s our
business to remember faces!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the girl, looking down at her reticule.</p>

<p>Her “oh!” had in it the faintest, the obscurest hint
of irony. He wondered whether she resented the idea
that he would remember her merely because it was a
bank’s business to remember faces. Possibly—but
no! As she smiled and dimpled he put from him the
thought that she wished to give a flirtatious turn to
this slight chance interview there in the open lobby of
his own bank. Reassured by the smite, supported by
the dimples, he said:</p>

<p>“I’m Mr. Burgess; I work here.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Yes, of course—you’re the president. My name
is Nellie Murdock.”</p>

<p>“You live in Vevay Street?” He dropped his voice.
“I can’t talk to you here, but I’ve been asked to see a
young man named Drake at your house. Please tell
him I’ll be there at five-thirty today. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you. He hasn’t come yet; but he expected
to get in at five.” Her lips quivered; she gave
him a quick, searching glance, then nodded and walked
rapidly out.</p>

<p>Burgess spoke to another customer in the line, with
his eyes toward the street, so that he saw the red
feather flash past the window and vanish; then he
strolled back to where the detective sat. On the
banker’s desk, face down, lay the memorandum he
had sent to the bookkeeper. He turned this up,
glanced at it and handed it to Hill.</p>

<p>“Balance $178.18; Julius Murdock,” Hill read.
“How much did Nellie draw?”</p>

<p>“An even hundred. I stopped to speak to her a
moment. Nice girl!”</p>

<p>“Gray eyes, fine teeth, nose slightly snub; laughs
easily and shows dimples. Wears usually a gold chain
with a gold heart-shaped locket—small diamond in
center,” said Hill, as though quoting.</p>

<p>“Locket—yes; I did notice the locket,” frowned
Burgess.</p>

<p>“And you didn’t overlook the dimples,” remarked
the detective—“you can’t exactly. By-the-way, you
didn’t change any money for her yourself?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Burgess with a scowl.
“Wait!” he added as the detective’s meaning dawned
upon him.</p>

<p>He went back into the cages. The clerk who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
brought the new bills from the women’s department
found the old ones where they had been tossed aside
by the teller. Burgess carried them to Hill without
looking at them. He did not believe what he knew
the detective suspected, that the girl was bold enough
to try to palm off counterfeit money on a bank—on
the president of a bank. He was surprised to find
that he was really deeply annoyed by the detective’s
manner of speaking of Nellie Murdock. He threw the
bills down on his desk a little spitefully.</p>

<p>“There you are! That girl took those identical
bills out of her satchel and gave them to me to change
for new ones. She had plenty of time to slip in a bad
bill if she wanted to.”</p>

<p>Hill turned round to the light, went over the bills
quickly and handed them back to the banker with a
grin.</p>

<p>“Good as wheat! I apologize. And I want you to
know that I never said she wasn’t a pretty girl. And
the prettiest ones are often the smartest. It does happen
that way sometimes.”</p>

<p>“You make me tired, Hill. Everybody you see is
crooked. With a man like you there’s no such thing
as presumption of innocence. ’Way down inside of
you you probably think I’m a bit off color too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t say just that!” said the detective,
laughing and taking the cigar Burgess offered him from
a box he produced from his desk. “I must be running
along. You don’t seem quite as cheerful as usual this
morning. I’ll come back tomorrow and see if I can’t
bring in a new story.”</p>

<p>Burgess disposed of several people who were waiting
to see him, and then took from his drawer the letter
he had been reading when the detective interrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
him. It was from Ralph Gordon, a Chicago lawyer,
who was widely known as an authority on penology.
Burgess had several times contributed to the funds of
a society of which Gordon was president, whose function
it was to meet criminals on their discharge from
prison and give them a helping hand upward.</p>

<p>The banker had been somewhat irritated today by
Hill’s manner of speaking of the criminals against whom
he was pitted; and doubtless Hill’s attitude toward the
young woman he had pointed out as the daughter of a
crook added to the sympathetic fading with which
Burgess took up his friend’s letter for another reading.
The letter ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Old Man: You said last fall that you
wished I’d put you in the way of knowing one
of the poor fellows I constantly meet in the
work of our society. I’m just now a good deal
interested in a young fellow—Robert Drake
by name—whose plight appeals to me particularly.
He is the black sheep of a fine family
I know slightly in New England. Drink
was his undoing, and after an ugly scrape in
college he went down fast—<i>facilis descensus</i>;
the familiar story. The doors at home were
closed to him, and after a year or two he fell in
with one of the worst gangs of yeggs in the
country. He was sent up for cracking a safe
in a Southern Illinois post office. The agent
of our society at Leavenworth has had an eye
on him; when he was discharged he came
straight to me and I took him into my house
until we could plan something for him. I
appealed to his family and they’ve sent me
money for his use. He wants to go to the
Argentine Republic—thinks he can make a
clean start down there. But there are difficulties.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Unfortunately there’s just now an
epidemic of yegging in the Middle West and
all suspects are being gathered in. Of course
Drake isn’t safe, having just done time for a
similar offense. I’ve arranged with Saxby—Big
Billy, the football half-back—you remember
him—to ship Drake south on one of the
Southern Cross steamers. Saxby is, as you
know, manager of the company at New Orleans.
I wanted to send Drake down direct—but
here’s the rub: there’s a girl in Indianapolis
he wants to marry and take along with
him. He got acquainted with her in the underworld,
and her people, he confesses, are a
shady lot. He insists that she is straight, and
it’s for her he wants to take a fresh grip and
begin over again. So tomorrow—that’s January
twenty-third—he will be at her house in
your city, 787 Vevay Street; and he means to
marry her. It’s better for him not to look
you up; and will you, as the good fellow you
are, go to see him and give him cash for the
draft for five hundred dollars I’m inclosing?
Another five hundred—all this from his father—I’m
sending to Saxby to give him in gold
aboard the steamer. Drake believes that in
a new country, with the girl to help him, he
can make good.</p>

<p>Hoping this isn’t taking advantage of an old
and valued friendship, I am always, dear old
man—</p>
</div>

<p>Burgess put the letter in his pocket, signed his mail,
entertained in the directors’ room a committee of the
Civic League, subscribed a thousand dollars to a hospital,
said yes or no to a number of propositions,
and then his wife called him on the telephone, with an
intimation that their regular dinner hour was seven.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
She reminded him of this almost daily, as Burgess
sometimes forgot to tell her when he was to dine
downtown.</p>

<p>“Anybody for dinner tonight?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Web,” she answered in the meek tone she
reserved for such moments as this. “Do I have to
tell you again that this is the day Bishop Gladding is
to be here? He said not to try to meet him, as he didn’t
know what train he’d take from Louisville, but he’d
show up in time for dinner. He wrote he was coming
a week ago, and you said not to ask anybody for
dinner, as you liked to have him to yourself. You
don’t mean to tell me——”</p>

<p>“No, Gertie; I’ll be there!” and then, remembering
that his too-ready acquiescence might establish a
precedent that would rise up and smite him later, he
added: “But these are busy days; if I should be late
don’t wait for me. That’s the rule, you know.”</p>

<p>“I should think, Web, when the bishop is an old
friend, and saved your life that time you and Ralph
Gordon were hunting Rocky Mountain sheep with him,
and the bishop nearly died carrying you back to a
doctor—I should think——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be there,” said Burgess; “but there’s a
friend of Gordon’s in town I’ll have to look up after
a little. No; he hasn’t time to come to the house.
You know how it is, Gertie——”</p>

<p>She said she knew how it was. These telephonic
colloquies were not infrequent between the Burgesses,
and Mrs. Burgess was not without her provocation.
He resolved to hurry and get through with Gordon’s
man, Drake, the newly freed convict seeking a better
life, that he might not be late to dinner in his own
house, which was to be enlivened by the presence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the young, vigorous missionary bishop, who was, moreover,
a sportsman and in every sense a man’s man.</p>

<p>He put on his ulster, made sure of the five hundred
dollars he had obtained on Gordon’s draft, and at
five-thirty went out to his car, which had waited an
hour.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A thaw had been in progress during the day and hints
of rain were in the air. The moon tottered drunkenly
among flying clouds. The bank watchman predicted
snow before morning as he bade Burgess good night.</p>

<p>Burgess knew Vevay Street, for he owned a business
block at its intersection with Senate Avenue. Beyond
the avenue it deteriorated rapidly and was filled with
tenements and cheap boarding houses. Several blocks
west ran an old canal, lined with factories, elevators,
lumber yards and the like, and on the nearer bank was a
network of railroad switches.</p>

<p>He thought it best not to approach the Murdock
house in his motor; so he left it at the drug-store
corner, and, bidding the chauffeur wait for him, walked
down Vevay Street looking for 787. It was a forbidding
thoroughfare and the banker resolved to complain to
the Civic League; it was an outrage that such Stygian
blackness should exist in a civilized city, and he meant
to do something about it. When he found the number
it proved to be half of a ramshackle two-story double
house. The other half was vacant and plastered with
For Rent signs. He struck a match and read a dingy
card that announced rooms and boarding. The window
shades were pulled halfway down, showing lights in
the front room. Burgess knocked and in a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the door was opened guardedly by a stocky, bearded
man.</p>

<p>“Mr. Murdock?”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” growled the man, widening
the opening a trifle to allow the hall light behind
him to fall on the visitor’s face.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed. A friend of Robert Drake’s
in Chicago asked me to see him. My errand is
friendly.”</p>

<p>A woman’s voice called from the rear of the hall:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, dad; let the gentleman in.”</p>

<p>Murdock slipped the bolt in the door and then
scrutinized Burgess carefully with a pair of small,
keen eyes. As he bent over the lock the banker noted
his burly frame and the powerful arms below his
rolled-up shirtsleeves.</p>

<p>“Just wait there,” he said, pointing to the front room.
He closed the hall door and Burgess heard his step on
the stairs.</p>

<p>An odor of stale cooking offended the banker’s
sensitive nostrils. The furniture was the kind he saw
daily in the windows of furniture stores that sell on
the installment plan; on one side was an upright piano,
with its top littered with music. Now that he was in
the house, he wondered whether this Murdock was
after all a crook, and whether the girl with the red
feather, with her candid eyes, could possibly be his
daughter. His wrath against Hill rose again as he
recalled his cynical tone—and on the thought the girl
appeared from a door at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>She bade him “Good evening!” and they shook hands.
She had just come from her day’s work at the lumber
company’s office, she explained. He found no reason
for reversing his earlier judgment that she was a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
pretty girl. Now that her head was free of the hat
with the red feather, he saw that her hair, caught up in
a becoming pompadour, was brown, with a golden
glint in it. Her gray eyes seemed larger in the light of
the single gas-burner than they had appeared by daylight
at the bank. There was something poetic and
dreamy about them. Her age he placed at about half his
own, but there was the wisdom of the centuries in
those gray eyes of hers. He felt young before her.</p>

<p>“There was a detective in the bank when I was in
there this morning. He knew me,” she said at once.</p>

<p>“Yes; he spoke of you,” said Burgess.</p>

<p>“And he knows—what does he know?”</p>

<p>The girl’s manner was direct; he felt that she was
entitled to a frank response.</p>

<p>“He told me your father had been—we will say
suspected in times past; that he had only lately come
here; but, unless he deceived me, I think he has no
interest in him just now. The detective is a friend
of mine. He visits the bank frequently. It was just
by chance that he spoke of you.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t tell him that Mr. Gordon had asked you
to come here?”</p>

<p>“No; Drake wasn’t mentioned.”</p>

<p>Nellie nodded; she seemed to be thinking deeply.
Her prettiness was enhanced, he reflected, by the few
freckles that clustered about her nose. And he was
ready to defend the nose which the detective, reciting
from his card catalogue, had called snub!</p>

<p>“Did your friend tell you Bob wants to be married
before he leaves? I suppose you don’t know that?”</p>

<p>She blushed, confirming his suspicion that it was she
whom Drake was risking arrest to marry.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Yes; and if I guess rightly that you’re the girl I’d
like to say that he’s an extremely fortunate young man!
You don’t mind my saying that!”</p>

<p>He wondered whether all girls who have dimples
blush to attract attention to them. The point interested
Webster G. Burgess. The thought that Nellie
Murdock meant to marry a freshly discharged convict,
no matter how promising he might be, was distasteful
to him; and yet her loyalty and devotion increased his
admiration. There was romance here, and much
money had not hardened the heart of Webster G.
Burgess.</p>

<p>“It all seems too good to be true,” she said happily,
“that Bob and I can be married after all and go away
into a new world where nobody knows us and he can
start all over again.” And then, coloring prettily:
“We’re all ready to go except getting married—and
maybe you can help us find a minister.”</p>

<p>“Easily! But I’m detaining you. Better have
Drake come in; I want to speak to him, and then we
can make all the arrangements in a minute.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s been watched; it’s brutal for them
to do that when he’s done his time and means to live
straight! I wonder——” She paused and the indignation
that had flashed out in her speech passed quickly.
“It’s asking a great deal, Mr. Burgess, but would you
let us leave the house with you? The quicker we go
the better—and a man of your position wouldn’t be
stopped. But if you’d rather not——”</p>

<p>“I was just going to propose that! Please believe
that in every way I am at your service.”</p>

<p>His spirits were high. It would give edge to the
encounter to lend his own respectability to the flight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
The idea of chaperoning Nellie Murdock and her
convict lover through an imaginable police picket
pleased him.</p>

<p>She went out and closed the door. Voices sounded in
the hall; several people were talking earnestly. When
the door opened a man dodged quickly into the room,
the girl following.</p>

<p>“This is Robert Drake, Mr. Burgess. Bob, this is
the gentleman Mr. Gordon told you about.”</p>

<p>Burgess experienced a distinct shock of repulsion
as the man shuffled across the room to shake hands.
A stubble of dark beard covered his face, his black
hair was crumpled, and a long bang of it lying across
his forehead seemed to point to his small, shifty blue
eyes. His manner was anxious; he appeared decidedly
ill at ease. Webster G. Burgess was fastidious and
this fellow’s gray suit was soiled and crumpled, and
he kept fingering his collar and turning it up round a
very dirty neck.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir—thank you!” he repeated nervously.</p>

<p>A door slammed upstairs and the prospective bridegroom
started perceptibly and glanced round. But
Burgess’s philosophy rallied to his support. This
was the fate of things, one of life’s grim ironies—that
a girl like Nellie Murdock, born and reared in the
underworld, should be linking herself to an outlaw.
After all, it was not his affair. Pretty girls in his own
world persisted in preposterous marriages. And Bob
grinned cheerfully. Very likely with a shave and a
bath and a new suit of clothes he would be quite
presentable. The banker had begun to speak of the
route to be taken to New Orleans when a variety of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
things happened so quickly that Burgess’s wits were
put to high tension to keep pace with them.</p>

<p>The door by the piano opened softly. A voice
recognizable as that of Murdock spoke sharply in a
low tone:</p>

<p>“Nellie, hit up the piano! Stranger, walk to the
window—slow—and yank the shade! Bob, cut upstairs!”</p>

<p>These orders, given in the tone of one used to command,
were quickly obeyed. It was in the banker’s
mind the moment he drew down the shade that by some
singular transition he, Webster G. Burgess, had committed
himself to the fortunes of this dubious household.
If he walked out of the front door it would likely
be into the arms of a policeman; and the fact of a man
of his prominence being intercepted in flight from a
house about to be raided would not look well in the
newspapers. Nellie, at the piano, was playing Schubert’s
Serenade—and playing it, he thought, very well.
The situation was not without its humor; and here,
at last, was his chance to see an adventure through.
He heard Bob take the stairs in three catlike jumps.
Nellie, at the piano, said over her shoulder, with Schubert’s
melody in her eyes:</p>

<p>“This isn’t funny; but they wouldn’t dare touch you!
You’d better camp right here.”</p>

<p>“Not if I know myself!” said Burgess with decision
as he buttoned his ulster.</p>

<p>She seemed to accept his decision as a matter of
course and, still playing, indicated the door, still ajar,
through which the disconcerting orders had been
spoken. Burgess stepped into a room where a table
was partly set for supper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“This ain’t no place for you, stranger!” said Murdock
harshly. “How you goin’ to get away?”</p>

<p>“I’ll follow Bob. If he makes it I can.”</p>

<p>“Humph! This party’s too big now. You ought to
have kept out o’ this.”</p>

<p>There was a knock at the front door and Murdock
pointed an accusing finger at Burgess.</p>

<p>“Either set down and play it out or skip!” He
jerked his head toward the stairs. The music ceased
at the knock. “Nellie, what’s the answer?”</p>

<p>Murdock apparently deferred to Nellie in the crisis;
and as the knock was repeated she said:</p>

<p>“I’ll get Bob and this gentleman out. Don’t try
to hold the door—let ’em in.”</p>

<p>Before he knew what was happening, Burgess was at
the top of the stairway, with the girl close at his heels.
She opened a door into a dark room.</p>

<p>“Bob!” she called.</p>

<p>“All right!” whispered Drake huskily.</p>

<p>Near the floor Burgess marked Bob’s position by a
match the man struck noiselessly, shielding it in the
curve of his hand at arm’s length. It was visible for a
second only. Nellie darted lightly here and there in
the dark. A drawer closed softly; Burgess heard the
swish of her jacket as she snatched it up and drew it on.
The girl undoubtedly knew what she was about. Then
a slim, cold hand clutched his in a reassuring clasp.
Another person had entered the room and the doorkey
clicked.</p>

<p>“Goodby, mother!” Burgess heard the girl whisper.</p>

<p>The atmosphere changed as the steps of the three
refugees echoed hollowly in an empty room. A door
closed behind them and there was a low rumble as a
piece of furniture was rolled against it. Burgess was
amazed to find how alert all his senses were. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
heard below the faint booming of voices as Murdock
entertained the police. In the pitch-dark he found
himself visualizing the room into which they had passed
and the back stairway down which they crept to the
kitchen of the vacant half of the house. As they paused
there to listen something passed between Drake and
Nellie.</p>

<p>“Give it to me—quick! I gotta shake that guy!”
Drake whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>The girl answered:</p>

<p>“Take it, but keep still and I’ll get you out o’ this.”</p>

<p>Burgess thought he had struck at her; but she made
no sign. She took the lead and opened the kitchen
door into a shed; then the air freshened and he felt
rain on his face. They stood still for an instant.
Some one, apparently at the Murdock kitchen door,
beat three times on a tin pan.</p>

<p>“There are three of them!” whispered Nellie.
“One’s likely to be at the back gate. Take the side
fence!” She was quickly over; and then began a rapid
leaping of the partition fences of the narrow lots of the
neighborhood. At one point Burgess’s ulster ripped on a
nail; at another place he dropped upon a chicken coop,
where a lone hen squawked her terror and indignation.
It had been some time since Webster G. Burgess had
jumped fences, and he was blowing hard when finally they
reached a narrow alley. He hoped the hurdling was at
an end, but a higher barricade confronted them than
the low fences they had already negotiated. Nellie
and Bob whispered together a moment; then Bob
took the fence quickly and silently. Burgess jumped
for the top, but failed to catch hold. A second try
was luckier, but his feet thumped the fence furiously
as he tried to mount.</p>

<p>“Cheese it on the drum!” said Nellie, and she gave his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
legs a push that flung him over and he tumbled into
the void. “Bob mustn’t bolt; he always goes crazy and
wants to shoot the cops,” he heard her saying, so close
that he felt her breath on his cheek. “I had to give
him that hundred——”</p>

<p>A man ran through the alley they had just left.
From the direction of Vevay Street came disturbing
sounds as the Murdocks’ neighbors left their supper
tables for livelier entertainment outside.</p>

<p>“If it’s cops they’ll make a mess of it—I was afraid
it was Hill,” said the girl.</p>

<p>It already seemed a good deal of a mess to Burgess.
He had got his bearings and knew they were in the huge
yard of the Brooks Lumber Company. Great piles of
lumber deepened the gloom. The scent of new pine
was in the moist air. Nellie was already leading the
way down one of the long alleys between the lumber.
A hinge creaked stridently behind them. The three
stopped, huddled close together. The opaque darkness
seemed now to be diminishing slightly as the moon and
a few frightened stars shone out of the clouds. Then
the blackness was complete again.</p>

<p>“They’ve struck the yard!” said Nellie. “That was
the Wood Street gate.”</p>

<p>“If they stop to open gates they’re not much good,”
said the banker largely, in the tone of one who does
not pause for gates.</p>

<p>The buttons had been snapped from his ulster at
the second fence and this garment now hung loosely
round him, a serious impediment to flight. He made
a mental note to avoid ulsters in future. A nail had
scraped his shin, and when he stopped to rub it he
discovered an ugly rent in his trousers. Nellie kept
moving. She seemed to know the ways of the yard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and threaded the black lumber alleys with ease. They
were close together, running rapidly, when she paused
suddenly. Just ahead of them in a cross-alley a lantern
flashed. It was the lumber company’s private watchman.
He stopped uncertainly, swung his lantern
into the lane where the trio waited, and hurried on.</p>

<p>They were halfway across the yard as near as Burgess
could judge, hugging the lumber piles closely and stopping
frequently to listen, when they were arrested by a
sound behind. The moon had again swung free of
clouds and its light flooded the yard. The distance of
half a block behind a policeman stood in the alley they
had just traversed. He loomed like a heroic statue in
his uniform overcoat and helmet. His shout rang
through the yard.</p>

<p>“Beat it!” cried Nellie.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Nellie was off as she gave the word. They struck a
well-beaten cross-alley—a main thoroughfare of the
yard—and sprinted off at a lively gait. It was in
Burgess’s mind that it was of prime importance that
Drake should escape—it was to aid the former convict
that he had involved himself in this predicament; and
even if the wedding had to be abandoned and the girl
left behind it was better than for them all to be caught.
He was keeping as close as possible to Bob, but the
young man ran with incredible swiftness; and he now
dodged into one of the narrower paths and vanished.</p>

<p>The yard seemed more intricate than ever with its
network of paths, along which the lumber stacks rose
fantastically. Looking over his shoulder, Burgess
saw that the single policeman had been reenforced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
another man. It was a real pursuit now—there was no
belittling that fact. A revolver barked and a fusillade
followed. Then the moon was obscured and the
yard was black again. Burgess felt himself jammed in
between two tall lumber piles.</p>

<p>“Climb! Get on top quick and lie down!”</p>

<p>Nellie was already mounting; he felt for the strips
that are thrust between planks to keep them from
rotting, grasped them and gained the top. It was a
solid pile and it lifted him twenty feet above the ground.
He threw himself flat just as the pursuers rushed by;
and when they were gone he sat up and nursed his
knees. He marked Nellie’s position by her low laugh.
He was glad she laughed. He was glad she was there!</p>

<p>Fifty yards away a light flashed—a policeman had
climbed upon a tall pile of lumber and was whipping
about him with a dark lantern.</p>

<p>“It will take them all night to cover this yard that
way,” she whispered, edging close. “They’re crossing
the yard the way women do when they’re trying
to drive chickens into a coop. They won’t find Bob
unless they commit burglary.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Burgess, finding a broken cigar
in his waistcoat pocket and chewing the end.</p>

<p>“Oh, I gave him the key to the office and told him to
sit on the safe. It’s a cinch they won’t look for him
there; and we’ve got all night to get him out.”</p>

<p>Burgess was flattered by the plural. Her good
humor was not without its effect on him. The
daughter of the retired yeggman was a new kind of girl,
and one he was glad to add to his collection of feminine
types. He wished she would laugh oftener.</p>

<p>The president of the White River National Bank,
perched on a pile of lumber on a wet January evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
with a girl he knew only as his accomplice in an escapade
that it would be very difficult to explain to a
cynical world, reflected that at about this hour his
wife, hardly a mile distant, in one of the handsomest
houses in town, was dressing for dinner to be ready to
greet a guest, who was the most valiant member of
the sedate House of Bishops. And Webster G. Burgess
assured himself that he was not a bit frightened; he
had been pursued by detectives and police and shot at—and
yet he was less annoyed than when the White
River National lost an account, or an ignorant new
member preempted his favorite seat in the University
Club dining room. He had lost both the sense of fear
and the sense of shame; and he marveled at his transformation
and delighted in it.</p>

<p>“How long will it be before that begins to bore them,
Nellie?” he remarked casually, as though he were
speaking to a girl he had known always, in a cozy
corner at a tea.</p>

<p>The answer was unexpected and it did not come from
Nellie. He heard the scraping of feet, and immediately
a man loomed against the sky not thirty feet away and
began sweeping the neighboring stacks with an electric
lamp; its rays struck Burgess smartly across the face.
He hung and jumped; and as he let go the light flashed
again and an automatic barked.</p>

<p>“Lord! It’s Hill!” he gasped.</p>

<p>As he struck the ground he experienced a curious
tingle on the left side of his head above the ear—it was
as though a hot needle had been drawn across it. The
detective yelled and fired another shot to attract
the attention of the other pursuers. Nellie was already
down and ready for flight. She grasped Burgess’s
arm and hurried him over and between unseen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
obstacles. There seemed to be no method of
locomotion to which he was not urged—climbing,
crawling, running, edging in between seeming Gibraltars
of lumber. From a low pile she leaped to a higher,
and on up until they were thirty feet above the ground;
then it seemed to amuse her to jump from pile to pile
until they reached earth again. Running over uneven
lumber piles in the dark, handicapped by an absurd
ulster, does not make for ease, grace or security—and
wet lumber has a disagreeable habit of being slippery.</p>

<p>They trotted across an open space and crept under a
shingle shed.</p>

<p>“Good place to rest,” panted Nellie—and he dropped
down beside her on a bundle of shingles. The rain fell
monotonously upon the low roof of their shelter.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty picture,” said the girl dreamily.</p>

<p>Burgess, breathing like a husky bellows, marveled
at her. What had interested her was the flashing of
electric lamps from the tops of the lumber piles, where
the pursuers had formed a semicircle and were closing
in on the spot where the quarry had disappeared.
They were leaping from stack to stack, shooting their
lamps ahead.</p>

<p>“The lights dancing round that way are certainly
picturesque,” observed Burgess. “Whistler would
have done a charming nocturne of this. I doubt
whether those fellows know what a charm they impart
to the mystical, moist night. The moving pictures
ought to have this. What’s our next move?” he
asked, mopping his wet face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get Bob out of the office and then take a
long jump. And right here’s a good time for you to
skedaddle. You can drop into the alley back of this
shed and walk home.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Thanks—but nothing like that! I’ve got to see
you married and safely off. I’d never dare look Gordon
in the face if I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were like that,” she said gently, and
his heart bounded at her praise. She stole away into
the shadows, and he stared off at the dancing lights
where the police continued their search.</p>

<p>Far away the banker saw the aura of the city, and he
experienced again a sensation of protest and rebellion.
He wondered whether this was the feeling of the hunted
man—the man who is tracked and driven and shot at!
He, Webster G. Burgess, had been the target of
a bullet; and, contrary to every rule of the life in
which he had been reared, he was elated to have been
the mark for a detective’s gun. He knew that he
should feel humiliated—that he owed it to himself,
to his wife waiting for him at home, to his friends, to
society itself, to walk out and free himself of the odium
that would attach to a man of his standing who had
run with the hare when his place by all the canons
was with the hounds. And then, too, this low-browed
criminal was not the man for a girl like Nellie to marry—he
could not free himself of that feeling.</p>

<p>As he pondered this she stole back to his hiding-place.
The ease, lightness and deftness with which she moved
amazed him; he had not known she was near until he
heard Drake’s heavier step beside her.</p>

<p>“Bob’s here, all right. We must march again,”
she said.</p>

<p>She explained her plan and the three started off
briskly, reached a fence—the world seemed to be a
tangle of fences!—and dropped over into a coalyard.
Burgess was well muddled again, but Nellie never
hesitated. It had grown colder; heavier clouds had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
drifted across the heavens and snow began to fall.
They reached the farther bound of the coalyard safely;
and as they were about to climb out a dog yelped and
rushed at them.</p>

<p>“I forgot about that dog! Over, quick! The
watchman for this yard is probably back there playing
with the police, or else he’s hiding himself,” said
Nellie.</p>

<p>This proved to be the most formidable fence of the
series for Burgess, and his companions got him over
with difficulty just as a dog snapped at his legs. They
landed in a tangle of ice-covered weeds and lay still a
moment. Bob was in bad humor, and kept muttering
and cursing.</p>

<p>“Chuck it, Bob!” said Nellie sharply.</p>

<p>They were soon jumping across the railroad switches
and could see the canal stretching toward the city,
marked by a succession of well-lighted bridges.</p>

<p>“They’ll pinch us here! Nellie, you little fool, if
you hadn’t steered me to that office I’d ’a’ been out
o’ this!”</p>

<p>He swore under his breath and Burgess cordially
hated him for swearing at the girl. But, beyond doubt,
the pursuers had caught the scent and were crossing
the coalyard. They heard plainly the sounds of men
running and shouting. Bob seized Nellie and there
was a sharp tussle.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, trust me, Bob! Take this; don’t
let him have it!” And she thrust a revolver into Burgess’s
hand. “Better be caught than that! Mind the
bank here and keep close together. Good dog—he’s
eating the cops!” And she laughed her delicious
mirthful laugh. A pistol banged and the dog barked
no more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>The three were now on the ice of the canal, spreading
out to distribute their weight. The day had been
warm enough to soften the ice and it cracked ominously
as the trio sped along. Half a dozen bridges were
plainly in sight toward the city and Burgess got his
bearings again. Four blocks away was his motor
and the big car was worth making a break for at any
hazard. They stopped under the second bridge and
heard the enemy charging over the tracks and out
upon the ice. A patrol wagon clanged on a bridge
beyond the coalyard and a whistle blew.</p>

<p>A sergeant began bawling orders and half a dozen
men were sent to reconnoiter the canal. As they
advanced they swept the banks with their electric
lamps and conferred with scouts flung along the banks.
The snow fell steadily.</p>

<p>“We can’t hold this much longer,” said Nellie;
and as she spoke there was a wild shout from the party
advancing over the ice. The lamps of several policemen
shot wildly into the sky and there were lusty bawls for
help.</p>

<p>“A bunch of fat cops breaking through the ice!”
chuckled the girl, hurrying on.</p>

<p>They gained a third bridge safely, Nellie frequently
admonishing Bob to stick close to her. It was clear
enough to Burgess that Drake wanted to be rid of him
and the girl and take charge of his own destiny. Burgess
had fallen behind and was feeling his way under
the low bridge; Nellie was ahead, and the two men
were for the moment flung together.</p>

<p>“Gi’ me my gun! I ain’t goin’ to be pinched this
trip. Gi’ me the gun!”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet; we’re all in the same boat!” panted
Burgess, whose one hundred and seventy pounds, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
registered on the club scales that very day after luncheon,
had warned him that he was growing pulpy.</p>

<p>The rails on the bank began to hum, and a switch
engine, picking up cars in the neighboring yards,
puffed along the bank. Burgess felt himself caught
suddenly round the neck and before he knew what
was happening landed violently on his back. He
struggled to free himself, but Bob gripped his throat
with one hand and snatched the revolver from his
pocket with the other. It was all over in a minute.
The rattle of the train drowned the sound of the
attack, and when Nellie ran back to urge them on
Burgess was just getting on his feet and Bob had
vanished.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stop him—he grabbed the gun and ran,”
Burgess explained. “He must have jumped on that
train.”</p>

<p>“Poor Bob!” She sighed deeply; a sob broke from
her. Her arms went around Burgess’s neck. “Poor
Bob! Poor old Bob!”</p>

<p>The locomotive bell clanged remotely. It was very
still, and Mr. Webster G. Burgess, president of the
White River National Bank, stood there under a canal
bridge with the arms of a sobbing girl round his neck!
Under all the circumstances it was wholly indefensible,
and the absurdity of it was not lost upon him. Drake
had bolted, and all this scramble with the ex-convict
and his sweetheart had come to naught.</p>

<p>“He’ll get away; he was desperate and he didn’t
trust me. He didn’t even wait for the money Gordon
sent me!”</p>

<p>“Oh!”—she faltered, and her breath was warm on
his cheek—“that wasn’t Drake!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“It wasn’t Robert Drake?” Burgess blurted. “Not
Drake?”</p>

<p>“No; it was Bob, my stepbrother. He got into
trouble in Kentucky and came here to hide, and I was
trying to help him; and I’ll miss Robert—and you’ve
spoiled your clothes—and they shot at you!”</p>

<p>“It was poor shooting,” said Burgess critically as
the red feather brushed his nose; “but we’ve got
to clear out of this or we’ll be in the patrol wagon in
a minute!”</p>

<p>It was his turn now to take the initiative. His first
serious duty was to become a decent, law-abiding
citizen again, and he meant to effect the transformation
as quickly as possible. He began discreetly by
unclasping the girl’s arms.</p>

<p>“Stop crying, Nellie—you did the best you could for
Bob; and now we’ll get out of this and tackle Drake’s
case. When that wagon that’s coming has crossed
this bridge we’ll stroll over to Senate Avenue, where
my car’s waiting, and beat it.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The policemen had been pried out of the ice and the
search continued, though the spirit seemed to have
gone out of it. The scouting party had scattered among
the grim factories along the railway tracks. Bob had
presumably been borne out of the zone of danger and
there was nothing more to be done for him.</p>

<p>They waited to make sure they were not watched
and then crawled up the bank into Vevay Street. The
rapidly falling snow enfolded them protectingly. Now
that life had grown more tranquil Burgess became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
conscious that the scratch above his left ear had not
ceased tingling. It was with real emotion that Webster
G. Burgess reflected that he had escaped death by a
hairbreadth. He meant to analyze that emotion later
at his leisure. The grazing of his head by that bullet
marked the high moment of his life; the memory of it
would forever be the chief asset among all his experiences.
There was a wet line down his cheek to
his shirt collar that he had supposed to be perspiration;
but his handkerchief now told another story. He
turned up the collar of his buttonless ulster to hide
any tell-tale marks of his sins and knocked his battered
cap into shape. Glancing down at Nellie, he saw that
the red feather had not lost its jauntiness, and she
tripped along placidly, as though nothing unusual had
happened; but as they passed opposite the Murdock
house, where a lone policeman patrolled the walk, her
hand tightened on his arm and he heard her saying, as
though to herself:</p>

<p>“Goodby, house! Goodby, dad and mother! I’ll
never be back any more.”</p>

<p>Burgess quickly shut the door of the tonneau upon
Nellie; he had cranked the machine and was drawing on
the chauffeur’s gauntlets, which he had found in the
driver’s seat, when the druggist ran out and accosted
him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Miller! Seen anything of my chauffeur?”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s out with the police,” the man answered
excitedly; “they’ve been chasing a bunch o’ crooks over
there somewhere. Two or three people have been shot.
There was a woman mixed up in the scrimmage, but
she got away.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it was a big fight—a whole gang of toughs!
I took a short dash with the police myself, and fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
over a dead man and scratched my ear. No, thanks;
I’ll fix it up later. By-the-way, when my man turns
up you might tell him to come home—if that harmonizes
with his own convenience.” He stepped into
the car. “Oh, has the plumber fixed that drain for
you yet? Well, the agent ought to look after such
things. Call me up in a day or two if he doesn’t
attend to it.”</p>

<p>It was rather cheering, on the whole, to be in the
open again, and he lingered, relishing his freedom, his
immunity from molestation. The very brick building
before which he stood gave him a sense of security; he
was a reputable citizen and property owner—not to be
trifled with by detectives and policemen. A newspaper
reporter whom he knew jumped from a passing street
car, recognized him and asked excitedly where the
bodies had been taken.</p>

<p>“They’re stacked up like cordwood,” answered
Burgess, “over in the lumber-yard. Some of the cops
went crazy and are swimming in the canal. Young
lady—guest of my wife—and I came over to look after
sick family, and ran into the show. I joined the hunt
for a while, but it wasn’t any good. You’ll find the
survivors camped along the canal bank waiting for
reenforcements.”</p>

<p>He lighted a cigarette, jumped in and drove the car
toward home for half a dozen blocks—then lowered the
speed so that he could speak to the girl. He was half
sorry the adventure was over; but there yet remained
his obligation to do what he could for Drake—if that
person could be found.</p>

<p>“You must let me go now,” said Nellie earnestly;
“the police will wake up and begin looking for me, and
you’ve had trouble enough. And it was rotten for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
to work you to help get Bob off! You’d better have
stayed in the house; but I knew you would help—and
I was afraid Bob would kill somebody. Please let me
out right here!”</p>

<p>Her hand was on the latch.</p>

<p>“Oh, never in this world! I have no intention of
letting the police take you—you haven’t done anything
but try to help your brother, like the fine girl you are;
and that’s all over. Where’s Drake?”</p>

<p>Her gravity passed instantly and her laugh greeted
his ears again. He was running the car slowly along a
curb, his head bent to hear.</p>

<p>“Listen! Robert telephoned just as I was leaving
the office. I told him to keep away from the house.
When I saw you in the bank I knew Bob was here, but
I thought he’d be out of the way; but he wouldn’t go
until dark, and I would have telephoned you but I was
afraid. I really meant to tell you at the house that
Robert wasn’t there and wouldn’t be there; but Bob
was so ugly I made you go with us, because I wanted
your help. I thought if they nailed us you would pull
Bob through. And now you don’t really mind—do
you?” she concluded tearfully.</p>

<p>“Well, what about Drake? If he’s still——”</p>

<p>She bent closer and he heard her murmurous laugh
again.</p>

<p>“I told Robert I’d meet him at the courthouse—by
the steps nearest the police station—at seven o’clock.
That’s the safest place I could think of.”</p>

<p>Burgess nodded and the machine leaped forward.</p>

<p>“We’ve got ten minutes to keep that date, Nellie.
But I’m going to be mighty late for dinner!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>As Nellie jumped from the car at the courthouse a
young man stepped out of the shadows instantly.
Only a few words passed between them. Burgess
opened the door for them and touched his hat as he
snapped on the electric bulb in the tonneau. Glancing
round when he had started the car, Burgess saw that
Drake had clasped Nellie’s hand; and there was a
resolute light in the young man’s eyes—his face had
the convict’s pallor, but he looked sound and vigorous.
On the whole, Robert Drake fulfilled the expectations
roused by Gordon’s letter—he was neatly dressed, and
his voice and manner bespoke the gentleman. One or
two questions put by the banker he answered reassuringly.
He had reached the city at five o’clock and
had not been interfered with in any way.</p>

<p>As they rolled down Washington Street a patrol
passed them, moving slowly toward the police station.
Burgess fancied there was dejection in the deliberate
course of the wagon homeward, and he grinned to
himself; but when he looked around Nellie’s face was
turned away from the street toward the courthouse
clock, to which she had drawn Drake’s attention as
the wagon passed.</p>

<p>“Are you and Nellie going to be married? That’s
the first question.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; it’s all on the square. There’s a lawyer
here who got me out of a scrape once and he helped me
get the license. If you’ll take us to a minister—that’s
all we want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the minister will be easy!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Now,” he said as they reached his home, “come
along with me and do exactly what I tell you. And
don’t be scared!”</p>

<p>The evening had been full of surprises, but he meant
now to cap the series of climaxes, that had mounted
so rapidly, with another that should give perfect symmetry
to the greatest day of his life. They entered
the house through a basement door and gained the
second floor by the back stairs. Nora, his wife’s maid,
came from one of the rooms and he gave her some orders.</p>

<p>“This is Miss Murdock. She’s just come in from
a long journey and I wish you would help her touch up
a bit. Go into Mrs. Burgess’s room and get anything
you need. Miss Murdock has lost her bag, and has to
be off again in half an hour; so fix up a suitcase for her—you’ll
know how. It will be all right with Mrs. Burgess.
How far’s the dinner got? Just had salad? All right.
Come with me, Drake.”</p>

<p>In his own dressing room he measured the young
man with his eye. Mindful of Gordon’s injunction
that Drake might be picked up by the police, he went
into the guest-room, tumbled over the effects of the
Bishop of Shoshone and threw out a worn sackcoat, a
clerical waistcoat and trousers, and handed them to
his guest.</p>

<p>Webster G. Burgess prided himself on being able
to dress in ten minutes; in fifteen on this occasion he
not only refreshed himself with a shower but tended
his bruises and fitted a strip of invisible plaster to the
bullet scratch above his ear. His doffed business suit
and ulster he flung into the laundry basket in the
bathroom; then he went into the guest-room to speak
to Drake.</p>

<p>“It was bully of you to stand by Nellie in her trouble!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
said Drake with feeling. “I guess you came near
getting pinched.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was nothing,” remarked Burgess, shooting
his cuffs with the air of a gentleman to whom a brush
with the police is only part of the day’s work.</p>

<p>“Nellie told me about it, coming up in the machine.
I guess you’re a good sport, all right.”</p>

<p>Webster G. Burgess was conscious of the ex-convict’s
admiration; he was not only aware that Drake regarded
him admiringly but he found that he was gratified by the
approbation of this man who had cracked safes and
served time for it.</p>

<p>“Nellie is a great girl!” said Burgess, to change the
subject. “I believe you mean to be good to her.
You’re a mighty lucky boy to have a girl like that
ready to stand by you! Here’s some money Gordon
asked me to give you. And here’s something for
Nellie, a check—one thousand—Saxby will cash it for
you at New Orleans. Please tell your wife tomorrow
that it’s my wife’s little wedding gift, in token of
Nellie’s kindness in keeping me out of jail. Now
where’s that marriage license? Good! There’s a bishop
in this house who will marry you; we’ll go down
and pull it off in a jiffy. Then you can have a nibble
of supper and we’ll take you to the station. There’s
a train for the South at eight-twenty.”</p>

<p>Nellie was waiting in the hall when they went out.
Nora had dressed her hair, and bestowed upon her a
clean collar and a pair of white gloves. She had exchanged
her shabby, wet tan shoes for a new pair
Mrs. Burgess had imported from New York. The mud
acquired in the scramble through the lumber-yard had
been carefully scraped from her skirt. Voices were
heard below.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“They’ve just come in from dinner,” said the maid,
“Shall I tell Bridget to keep something for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes—something for three, to be on the table in
fifteen minutes.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Webster G. Burgess always maintains that
nothing her husband may do can shock her. When her
husband had not appeared at seven she explained to
her guest that he had been detained by an unexpected
meeting of a clearing-house committee, it being no
harder to lie to a bishop than to any one else when a
long-suffering woman is driven to it. She was discussing
with the Bishop of Shoshone the outrageously
feeble support of missionaries in the foreign field when
she heard steps on the broad stair that led down to
the ample hall. A second later her husband appeared
at the door with a young woman on his arm—a young
woman who wore a hat with a red feather. This
picture had hardly limned itself upon her acute intelligence
before she saw, just behind her husband and
the strange girl, a broad-shouldered young clergyman
who bore himself quite as though accustomed to appearing
unannounced in strange houses.</p>

<p>The banker stepped forward, shook hands with the
bishop cordially, and carried off the introductions
breezily.</p>

<p>“Sorry to be late, Gertie; but you know how it is!”
Whereas, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Burgess did not
know at all how it was. “Bishop, these young people
wish to be married. Their time is short, as they have
a train to make. Just how they came to be here is a
long story, and it will have to wait. If you see anything
familiar in Mr. Drake’s clothes please don’t be
distressed, I’ve always intended doing something for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
your new cathedral, and you shall have a check and
the price of a new suit early in the morning. And,
Gertie”—he looked at his watch—“if you will find a
prayerbook we can proceed to business.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess always marveled at her husband’s
plausibility, and now she had fresh proof of it. She
blinked as he addressed the girl as Nellie; but this
was just like Web Burgess!</p>

<p>The Bishop of Shoshone, having married cowboys and
Indians in all manner of circumstances in his rough
diocese, calmly began the service.</p>

<p>At the supper table they were all very merry except
Nellie, whose face, carefully watched by Mrs. Burgess,
grew grave at times—and once her eyes filled with
tears; her young bridegroom spoke hardly at all.
Burgess and the bishop, however, talked cheerfully of
old times together, and they rose finally amid the
laughter evoked by one of the bishop’s stories. Burgess
said he thought it would be nice if they all went to the
station to give the young people a good sendoff for
their long journey; and afterward they could look in at
a concert, for which he had tickets, and hear Sembrich
sing.</p>

<p>“After a busy day,” he remarked, meeting Nellie’s
eyes at one of her tearful moments, “there’s nothing
like a little music to quiet the nerves—and this has
been the greatest day of my life!”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The president of the White River National Bank
was late in reaching his desk the next morning. When
he crossed the lobby he limped slightly; and his secretary,
in placing the mail before him, noticed a strip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of plaster above his left ear. His “Good morning!”
was very cheery and he plunged into work with his
usual energy.</p>

<p>He had dictated a telegram confirming a bond deal
that would net him fifty thousand dollars, when his
name was spoken by a familiar voice. Swinging round
to the railing with calculated deliberation he addressed
his visitor in the casual tone established by their
intimacy:</p>

<p>“Hello, Hill—looking for me?”</p>

<p>“Nope; not yet!”</p>

<p>Both men grinned as their eyes met.</p>

<p>“Has the charming Miss Murdock been in this
morning?” asked the detective, glancing toward the
tellers’ cages.</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen her yet. Hope you’re not infatuated
with the girl.”</p>

<p>“Only in what you might call an artistic sense;
I think we agreed yesterday that she’s rather pleasing
to the jaded eyesight. See the papers?”</p>

<p>“What’s in the papers?” asked the banker, feeling
absently for a report a clerk had laid on his desk.</p>

<p>“Oh, a nice little muss out on Vevay Street last
night! The cops made a mess of it of course. Old
Murdock’s son Bob shot a constable in Kentucky and
broke for the home plate to get some money, and I’d
had a wire to look out for him when I was in here
yesterday. He handled some very clever phony money
in this district a while back. I went out to Vevay
Street to take a look at him—and found the police
had beat me to it! The cash Nellie drew yesterday
was for him.”</p>

<p>“Of course you got him!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Hill; “he made a getaway, all right. It
was rather funny though——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“How funny?”</p>

<p>“The chase he gave us. You don’t mean you haven’t
heard about it!”</p>

<p>Burgess clasped his hands behind his head and
yawned.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you repeatedly, Hill, that I don’t read
criminal news. It would spoil the fun of hearing you
explain your own failures.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t bore you with this. I only want you
to understand that it was the police who made a
fluke of it. But I can’t deny those Murdocks do interest
me a good deal.”</p>

<p>He bent his keen eyes upon the banker for a second
and grinned. Burgess returned the grin.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to speak before the Civic League on our
municipal government tomorrow night, and I’ll throw
something about the general incompetence of our
police force—it’s undoubtedly rotten!”</p>

<p>The detective lingered.</p>

<p>“By-the-way, I nearly overlooked this. Seems to be
a silver card-case, with your name neatly engraved on
the little tickets inside. I picked it up on the ice
last night when I was skating on the canal. I’m
going to keep one of the cards as a souvenir.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly welcome, Tom. You’d better try one of
these cigars.”</p>

<p>Hill chose a cigar with care from the extended box
and lighted it. Burgess swung round to his desk,
turned over some letters, and then looked up as though
surprised to find the detective still there.</p>

<p>“Looking for me, Tom?”</p>

<p>“No; not yet!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CAMPBELLS ARE COMING</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not to be counted against Mrs. Robert Fleming
Ward that at forty-five she had begun to look backward
a little wistfully and forward a little disconsolately
and apprehensively. She was a good woman, indeed
one of the best of women, loyal, conscientious and self-sacrificing
in the highest degree. But she was poignantly
aware that certain ambitions dear to her heart
had not been realized. Robert Fleming Ward had
not attained that high place at the Sycamore County
bar which had been his goal, and he seemed unable to
pull himself to the level with Canby Taylor and
Addison Swiggert who practiced in federal jurisdictions
and were not unknown to the docket of the United
States Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Even as Mrs. Ward was a good woman, so her husband
Robert was a good man and a good lawyer.
But just being good wasn’t getting the Wards anywhere.
At least it wasn’t landing them within the golden
portals of their early dreams. To find yourself marking
time professionally and socially in a town of seventy-five
thousand souls, that you’ve seen grow from twenty-five
thousand, is a disagreeable experience if you are a
sensitive person. And Mrs. Ward was sensitive.
It grieved her to witness the prosperity flaunted by
people like the Picketts, the Shepherds, the Kirbys
and others comparatively new to the community, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
had impudently availed themselves of Sycamore
County’s clay to make brick, and of its water power to
turn the wheels of industries for which the old-time
Kernville pioneer stock had gloomily predicted failure.</p>

<p>The Picketts, the Shepherds, the Kirbys and the rest
of the new element had builded themselves houses
that were much more comfortable and pleasing to the
eye than the houses of the children and grandchildren
of the old families that had founded Kernville away
back when Madison was president. The heads of the
respective brick, box, match, bottle, canning, and
strawboard industries might be deficient in culture but
they did employ good architects. The Wards lived in
a house of the Queen Anne period, which it had been
necessary to mortgage to send John Marshall through
college and give Helen a year at a Connecticut finishing
school. The Wards’ home had deteriorated to the
point of dinginess, and the dinginess, and the inability
to keep a car, or to return social favors, or belong to
the new country club weighed heavily upon Mrs. Ward.</p>

<p>Her husband, with all his industry and the fine
talents she knew him to possess, was making no more
money at forty-seven than he had made at thirty-five.
She was a little bewildered to find that socially she
had gradually lost contact with the old aristocracy
without catching step with the flourishing makers of
brick and other articles of commerce that were carrying
the fame of Kernville into new territory. And as
Mrs. Ward was possessed of a pardonable pride, this
situation troubled her greatly. They had been unable
to send John to the Harvard Law School, but he had
made a fine record in the school of the state university,
and his name now appeared beneath his father’s on
the door of the law office on the second floor of the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Wheatley block, which had been pretty well deserted
by tenants now that Kernville boasted a modern
ten-story office building.</p>

<p>John Ward was a healthy, sanguine young fellow
who had every intention of getting on. Some of the
friends he had made in law school threw him some
business, and it was remarked about the courthouse
that John had more punch than his father, and was
bound to succeed. Half way through the trial of a
damage suit in which the firm of Ward &amp; Ward represented
a plaintiff who had been run down by an inter-urban
car, the senior Ward was laid up with tonsilitis,
and John carried the case through and won a verdict
for twice what the plaintiff had been led to believe he
could possibly get.</p>

<p>Helen Ward was quite as admirable and interesting
as her brother. The finishing school had done her no
harm and she returned to Kernville without airs,
assumptions or affectations, understanding perfectly
that her parents had done the best they could for her.
She was nineteen, tall and straight, fair, with an
abundance of brown hair and blue-gray mirthful eyes.
The growing inability of her mother to maintain a
maid-of-all work, now that Kernville’s eligibles for
domestic service preferred the eight-hour day of the
factories to house work, did not trouble Helen particularly.
She could cook, wash, iron, cut out a dress
and sew it together and if the furniture was wobbly
and the upholstery faded she was an artist with the
glue-pot and her linen covers on the chairs gave the
parlor a fresh smart look. The humor that was denied
their parents was Helen’s and John’s portion in large
measure. They were of the Twentieth Century,
spoke its language and knew all its signs and symbols.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
They were proud of each other, shared their pleasures
and consoled each other in their disappointments,
and resolutely determined to make the best of a world
that wasn’t such a bad place after all.</p>

<p>John reached home from the office on a day early in
January and found Helen preparing supper.</p>

<p>“Great scott, sis; has that last girl faded already!”</p>

<p>“Skipped, vamoosed, vanished!” Helen answered,
looking up from the gas range on which she was broiling
a steak. “The offer of a dollar more a week transferred
her to the Kirby’s, where she’ll have nothing to
do but cook. The joke’s on them. She’s the worst
living cook, and not even a success in hiding her
failures.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” said John, helping himself to a stalk of
celery and biting it meditatively, “I hope the Kirbys
suffer the most frightful tortures before they die of
indigestion. Haven’t invited us to the party they’re
giving, have they?”</p>

<p>“Not unless our invitations got lost in the mails.
And I hear it’s going to be a snappy function with the
refreshments and a jazz band imported from Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Look here, sis, that’s rubbing it in pretty hard!
I don’t care for myself, but it’s nasty of ’em to cut you.
But in a way it’s an act of reprisal. Mother didn’t
ask Mrs. Kirby and Jeannette to the tea she threw for
that national federation swell just before Christmas.
But even at that——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be so analytical! We’re an old family
and mama refuses to see any merit in people whose
grandparents didn’t settle here before the Indians left.
And as we haven’t the money to train with the ancient
aristocracy, we’ve got to huddle on the sidelines.
Pardon me, dear, but that’s a pound of butter you’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
about to sit on! You might cut a slice and place it
neatly on yonder plate.”</p>

<p>“Snobbery!” said John, as he cut the butter with
exaggerated deliberation;—“snobbery is a malady, a
disease. You can’t kill it; you’ve got to feed it its
own kind of pabulum. It’s as plain as daylight that
we’ve got to do something to get out of the hole or
we’re stuck for good.”</p>

<p>“We might bore for oil in the back yard,” said Helen,
scrutinizing the steak. “If we struck a gusher we
could break into the country club and buy a large
purple limousine like the Kirbys.”</p>

<p>“My professional engagements don’t exhaust my
brain power at present, and I’m giving considerable
thought to ways and means of improving our state,
condition or status as a family of exalted but unrecognized
merit.”</p>

<p>“You’re doing nobly, John! Tom Reynolds told me
they were talking of running you for prosecuting attorney.
That would give you a grand boost. And
there’s Alice Hovey,—I understand all about that,
John. I think you’re mistaken about the Hoveys
not liking you.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Alice!” he exclaimed mockingly. “Papa and
mama Hovey have quite other ideas for Alice; no
penniless barrister need apply! But I won’t deny to
you that I’m pretty keen about Alice, only when I go
to the house the fond parents create a low temperature
that is distinctly chilly. Listen to me, Helen,” he
went on with an abrupt change of tone. “You and
Ned Shepherd were hitting it off grandly when something
happened. He’s a fine chap and I rather got the
idea that you two would make a match of it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Oh no!” she protested, quickly but unconvincingly
as she transferred the steak to the platter.</p>

<p>“His family’s trying to switch him to Sally Pickett.
He hasn’t been here lately, but you do see him occasionally?”</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes as she swung round from
the range.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to stop that, John! I’m ashamed of myself
for meeting him as I’ve been doing—walking with him
in the back streets and letting him talk to me over
the telephone when mama isn’t round. I didn’t
know——”</p>

<p>“Well, I just happened to spot you Monday evening,
and I meant to speak to you about it. Not exactly
nice, sis. I’m sorry about the whole business. Ned’s
really a manly chap, and I don’t believe he’ll be bullied
into giving you up.”</p>

<p>“All over now, John,” she answered with badly-feigned
indifference.</p>

<p>“Well, the course of true love never did run smooth.
Father and mother have done their almighty best
for us, but changes have come so fast in this burg they
haven’t been able to keep up with the procession.
Father misses chances now and then, as in refusing
the Pickett case when the State went after him for
polluting the river with refuse from his strawboard mill.
Dad thought the prosecution was justified and foolishly
volunteered to assist the State as a public duty. Pickett
lost and had to spend a lot of money changing his
plant; so he’s knocked us whenever he got a chance.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like papa. I only wish we could do
something really splendid for him and mama.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to, sis,” said John confidently. “Take
it from me we’re going to do that identical thing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Now give me the potatoes and the coffee-pot. Precede
me with the bread and butter. There’s mother at
the front door now. Step high as to the strains of a
march of triumph. We’ll give a fine exhibition of a
happy family, one for all and all for one!”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mrs. Ward, detained by a club committee meeting,
began to apologize for not getting home in time to
assist with the supper.</p>

<p>“Oh, John did all the heavy work! And we had a
fine talk into the bargain,” Helen replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>As her father was tired and didn’t know the
latest domestic had departed hence, she went on with
an ironic description of the frailties and incapacity
of that person and pictured the gloom of the Kirbys
as they ate her initial meal. Mrs. Ward had brought
the afternoon mail to the table. She was the corresponding
secretary of a state federation which used the
mails freely. She ate in silence, absorbed in her letters,
while her husband praised Helen’s cooking.</p>

<p>Ward found a real joy in his children. It was not lost
upon him that they were making the best of circumstances
for which in a somewhat bewildered fashion
he felt himself responsible. Their very kindness, their
disposition to make the best of things, hurt him and
deepened his growing sense of defeat. John began
talking of a case they were to try shortly. He had
found some decisions that supported the contention of
their client. They were explaining it to Helen, who
teased them by perversely taking the opposite view,
when they were silenced by an exclamation from Mrs.
Ward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Here’s news indeed! This is a note from Mrs.
Campbell, the Ruth Sanders who was my best friend at
school,—Mrs. Walter Scott Campbell,” she added
impressively, looking round at them over her glasses.
“It’s short; I’ll just read it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dearest Iphigenia</span>:—</p>


<p>(“You know the girls at Miss Woodburn’s school
always called me Iphigenia—due to a stupid answer I
once gave in the literature class.)</p>



<p>“It’s so sweet of you to remember me year
after year with a Christmas card. The very
thought of you always brings up all the jolly
times we had at Miss Woodburn’s. We
parted with a promise to meet every year;
and I have never set eyes on you since we
sat side by side at the closing exercises! The
class letter doesn’t come around any more,
but your children must be grown up. Mine
are very much so and getting married and
leaving Walter and me quite forlorn.</p>


<p>(“Her daughter Angela married into that Thornton
family of Rhode Island—or maybe it was the Connecticut
branch—who are so terribly rich; made it in copper;
no, I believe it was rubber.)</p>



<p>“Don’t be startled, but Mr. Campbell and
I are planning to go to California next month,
and as we have to pass right across your
state, it seems absurd not to stop and see you.
I’ve looked up the timetables and we can
easily leave the Limited at Cleveland and
run down to Kernville. Now don’t go to any
trouble for us, but treat us just as old friends
and if it isn’t convenient to stay with you
for a night—we just must have a night to gossip
about the old days—we can put up at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
hotel. We shan’t leave here until February
17, but wishing to acknowledge your card—I
never can remember to send Christmas cards—I
thought I’d give you fair warning of our
approach. Always, dear Iphigenia, your affectionate,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ruth</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s a charming letter!” Helen volunteered, as
her mother’s gaze invited approval of Mrs. Campbell’s
graciousness in promising a visit. “She must be
lovely!”</p>

<p>“Ruth was the dearest of all my girlhood friends!
When she had typhoid and her family were in Europe
I was able to do little things for her;—nothing really
of importance—but she has never forgotten. She was
so appreciative and generous and always wanted her
friends to share her good times!”</p>

<p>All their lives John and Helen had heard their mother
sing the praises of Mrs. Walter Scott Campbell, née
Sanders, until that lady had assumed something of the
splendor of a mythical figure in their imaginations.
She had been the richest girl in the Hudson River school
Mrs. Ward had attended, and she had married wealth.
The particular Campbell of her choice had inherited a
fortune which he had vastly augmented. When occasionally
a New York newspaper drifted into the house
Mrs. Ward scanned the financial advertisements for
the name of Walter Scott Campbell set out in bold
type as the director of the most august institutions.</p>

<p>“I suppose——” Mrs. Ward’s tone expressed awe
in all its connotations;—“I suppose Mr. Campbell is
worth fifty million at the lowest calculation. I met
him years ago at one of the school dances. He was
quite wild about Ruth then, and they were married,
John, just a year before we were. I still have the invitation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and Ruth sent me a piece of the wedding cake.
And from the photograph she sent me at Christmas
two years ago, I judge that time has dealt lightly
with her.”</p>

<p>“Campbell’s one of the most important men in Wall
Street,” Ward assented. “One of his institutions, The
Sutphen Loan &amp; Trust, financed the Kernville Water
Power Company, a small item of course for so big a
concern. Campbell probably never heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, men of his calibre usually know where the
dollars go,” said John, whose wits were functioning
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Of course we simply can’t let them go to the
hotel,” continued Mrs. Ward; “the Kipperly House
is a disgrace. And if Ruth hasn’t changed a lot in
twenty-six years she’ll accept us as she finds us. Our
guest-room needs redecorating, and we can hardly
keep the jackets on the parlor furniture right in the
middle of winter; and the bathroom fixtures ought
to be replaced——”</p>

<p>She paused, seeing the look of dejection on her husband’s
face. He was well aware that all these things
were old needs which the coming of important guests
now made imperative. Mrs. Ward carefully thrust the
note back into its envelope. John exchanged telegraphic
glances with Helen. His eyes brightened with
the stress of his thoughts but he buttered a bit of
bread before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, mother,” he began briskly, “I’m sure we’re
all tickled that your old friend’s coming. I can just
see you sitting up all night talking of the midnight
spreads you had, and how you fooled the teachers.
Now don’t worry about the house—you or father,
either; I’m going to manage that.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“But, John, we mustn’t add to your father’s worries.
I realize perfectly that we’re in debt and can’t spend
money we haven’t got. Ruth was always a dear—so
considerate of every one—and we’ll hope it’s me and
my family and not the house she’s coming to see.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, mother, but this strikes me as
something more than a casual visit. I see in it the
hand of Providence!” he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“If they carry a maid and valet as part of their
scenery we’re lost—hopelessly lost!” Helen suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, not necessarily!” John replied. “We’ll stow
’em away somewhere. In a pinch, you and I can move
to the attic. Anyhow, we’ve got a month to work in.
When we begin to get publicity for the coming of the
rich and distinguished Campbells, I miss my guess if
things don’t begin to look a lot easier.”</p>

<p>“But, John,” his mother began, shaking her head
with disapproval, “you wouldn’t do anything that
would look—vulgar?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, but the Sunday <i>Journal’s</i> always
keen for news of impending visitors in our midst, and
no people of the Campbells’ social and financial standing
have ever honored our city with their presence.
The president of the Transcontinental did park his
private car in the yards last summer, but before the
Chamber of Commerce could tackle him about building
a new freight house he faded away.”</p>

<p>“Walter Scott Campbell is a director in the Transcontinental,”
remarked Mrs. Ward. “I happened to
see his name in the list when I looked up the name of
the company’s secretary to send on the resolutions of
the Women’s Municipal Union complaining of the vile
condition of the depot.”</p>

<p>“Such matters are never passed on in the New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
offices,” Ward suggested mildly. “Our business organizations
have worked on the General Manager for
years without getting anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Just a word, from a man of Mr. Campbell’s power
will be enough,” replied John spaciously. “For another
thing the train schedule ought to be changed to
give us a local sleeper to Chicago. We’ll stir up the
whole service of the Transcontinental when we get
Walter here!”</p>

<p>“Walter!” exclaimed Mrs. Ward, aghast at this
familiarity.</p>

<p>“Better call him Walt, John, to make him feel at
home,” suggested Helen.</p>

<p>“The directors of the Water Power Company want
to refund their bonds. I suppose Mr. Campbell could
help about that,” Ward remarked, interested in spite
of himself in the potentialities of the impending visit.</p>

<p>“But it would be a betrayal of hospitality,” Mrs.
Ward protested, “and we mustn’t do anything to spoil
their visit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that visit’s going to be a great thing for Kernville!
It grows on me the more I think of it,” said
John loftily. “It’s our big chance to do something for
the town. And the Campbells can’t object. They will
pass on, never knowing the vast benefits they have
conferred upon mankind.”</p>

<p>“Your imagination’s running away with you, John,”
said his father. “With only one day here to renew
their acquaintance with your mother they’ll hardly
care to be dragged through the factories and over the
railway yards.”</p>

<p>“While mother and Helen are entertaining Mrs.
Campbell, we’ll borrow the largest car in town and
show Walter the sights. And it will be up to us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
prove to him that Kernville’s the best little town of
the seventy-five thousand class in the whole rich valley
of the Mississippi. All Walter will have to do will be
to send a few wires in a casual manner to the right
parties and everything the town needs will be forthcoming.”</p>

<p>“But why should we worry about the town when it
isn’t worrying particularly about us?” asked Helen as
she began to clear the table.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite follow you either,” said his mother.
“You can’t, you really mustn’t——”</p>

<p>“Such matters are for the male of the species to
grapple with. You and Helen arrange a tea or dinner
or whatever you please, making something small and
select of the function, and I’ll do all the rest.”</p>

<p>“In some way John and I will manage the money,”
said Mr. Ward, slowly, and then catching a meaningful
look in John’s eyes, he added with unwonted confidence:
“Where there’s a will there’s a way. I want
the Campbells’ visit to be a happy occasion. You are
entitled to it, Margaret—you and Helen must get all
the pleasure possible from meeting a woman of Mrs.
Campbell’s large experience of life.”</p>

<p>“Mama will need a new frock,” said Helen, a remark
which precipitated at once a lively debate with her
mother as to which—if any item of her existing wardrobe
would lend itself to the process of reconstruction.
This question seemed susceptible of endless discussion,
and was only ended by John’s firm declaration that
there should be new raiment for both his mother and
Helen.</p>

<p>“Father, we’ll show these upstarts from New York
what real American women are like!”</p>

<p>“We shall be ruined!” cried Helen tragically, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
disappeared through the swing door with a pile of
plates.</p>

<p>“Please, John, don’t do anything foolish,” his mother
pleaded, but she smiled happily under the compulsion
of his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Trust me for that!” he replied, laying his hands on
her shoulders. “We’re all too humble; that’s what’s
the matter with the Ward family. And for once I
want you to step right out!”</p>

<p>He waved her into the sitting room and darted into
the kitchen, where he threw off his coat and donned
an apron.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>“Crazy! You’ve gone plumb stark crazy!” said
Helen, as she thrust her arms into the dishwater.
“It’s cruel to raise mother’s hopes that way. You
know well enough that as things are going we’re just
about getting by, with the grocery bill two months
behind and that eternal interest on the mortgage hanging
over us like the well-known sword of Damocles.”</p>

<p>“The sword is in my hands!” declared John, balancing
a plate on the tip of his finger. “How does
that old tune go?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The Campbells are coming, tra la, tra la,</div>
<div class="verse">The Campbells are coming, tra la!</div>
</div></div>

<p>There’s a bit of Scotch in us, and I feel my blood tingle
to those blithe martial strains! What’s the rule for
drying dishes, sis? Do you make ’em shine like a collar
from a Chinese laundry, or is the dull domestic finish
in better form?”</p>

<p>“If you break that plate I’ll poison your breakfast
coffee! If I didn’t know you for a sober boy I’d think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
you’d been keeping tryst with a bootlegger! You don’t
seem to understand that you sat there at the table
spending money like Midas on a spree. You couldn’t
borrow a cent if you tried!”</p>

<p>“Borrow!” he mocked. “I’m going to pull this
thing off according to specifications, and I’m not going
to borrow a cent. I expect to be refusing offers of
money gently but firmly within a week. Observe my
smoke, dearest one! Watch my fleet sail right up to
the big dam in Sycamore River laden like the ships
of Tarshish that brought gifts of silver and gold and
ivory, apes and peacocks for Solomon’s delight!”</p>

<p>“You’re not calling the Campbells apes and peacocks!”</p>

<p>“Not on your life! All those rich treasures will be
yours and mine, O Helen of Kernville! The Campbells
are rich enough. We’re not going to embarrass
them by piling any more wealth on ’em. But the
magic of the name of Walter Scott Campbell, if properly
invoked, manipulated and flaunted will put us all
on the high road to fame and fortune.”</p>

<p>“You’ll break mama’s heart if you begin bragging
about her acquaintance with this woman she hasn’t
seen for a quarter of a century! She’s already warned
you against vulgar boasting.”</p>

<p>“Keep mother busy planning for the care and entertainment
of our guests! I’ll hold father steady. This
being Thursday I’ve got time enough to plan the campaign
before Sunday. I’ll lay down a barrage and
throw myself upon the enemy. To the cheering strains
of ‘The Campbells are Coming!’ we’ll cross the valley
of death and plant our flag on the battlements without
a scratch or the loss of a man.”</p>

<p>By the time the kitchen was in order he had her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
laughing and quite won to his idea that it was perfectly
legitimate to avail themselves fully of the great opportunity
offered by the Campbells’ visit.</p>

<p>“Nothing undignified at all! The Campbells will
never be conscious of my proceedings as they don’t
read the Kernville papers and will linger only a day.
By the way, it happens that Billy Townley, a fraternity
brother of mine, has just been made city editor
of the <i>Journal</i> and Billy and I used to pull some good
stunts when we were together at the ’varsity. When
I hiss the password in his ear and tell him I’ll need a
little space daily for a few weeks he’ll go right down
the line for me. And the boys on the <i>Evening Sun</i>
are friends of mine, too. They have less space but
they make up for it with bigger headlines.”</p>

<p>“You’re a dear boy, John, if you are crazy! I believe
you can do most anything you tackle, and I’ll
stand by you whether you land us in jail or in the
poorhouse.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you, sis!” And then lowering his voice,
“This chance may never come again! I’m going to
wring every possible drop out of it even as you wring
out that dish rag. By-the-way, if it isn’t impertinent,
when did you see Ned last?”</p>

<p>“Not since the day you saw me walking with him—for
the last time. But he telephoned this afternoon.
He wanted to come up this evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s of age and the curfew law can’t touch
him. What was the answer?”</p>

<p>“I told him I wouldn’t be at home. I’m not going
to have him calling here when his mother barely speaks
to me! Ned didn’t say so, but I suspect she gave him
a good scolding for taking me instead of Sally to the
Seebrings’ dance.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“How do you get that? If he didn’t tell you——!”</p>

<p>“Of course not! But Sally had to go with her
mother and there were more girls than men; so Sally
only had about half the dances and the rest of the time
sat on the sidelines with her mother and Mrs. Kirby.
I caught a look now and then that was quite suggestive
of murder in the first degree.”</p>

<p>“Helen,” said John, lifting his eyes dreamily to the
ceiling, “I’ll wager a diamond tiara against one of
your delicious buckwheat cakes that you and I will
get an invitation to the Kirby party.”</p>

<p>“Taken! The cards went out yesterday. I met
some of the girls downtown this morning, and they
were buzzing about it.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em buzz! Ours will probably come special
delivery with a note of explanation that in copying the
list or something of the kind we were regrettably omitted.
And let me see,” he went on, rubbing his chin reflectively,
“I rather think Ned will ask you to go to the
party with him. It occurs to me that old man Shepherd
owns some land he’s trying to sell to the Transcontinental,
and the railway people are shy of it because
it’s below the flood line on our perverse river. Yes;
I think we may jar the Shepherds a little too.”</p>

<p>“Why, John!” she laughed as she hung up her
apron, “you almost persuade me that you’ve already
got free swing at the Campbell boodle!”</p>

<p>“I look at it this way, Helen. We can all spend our
own money; it’s getting the benefit of other people’s
money that requires genius. I must now step down
to the public library and to the <i>Journal</i> office to get
some dope on the Campbells. Also I’ll have to sneak
mother’s photograph of Mrs. Campbell out of the
house. A few illustrations will give tone to our publicity
stuff.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Be bold, John, but not too bold!”</p>

<p>“‘The Campbells are coming, tra la!’” he sang
mockingly, and spiking her hands, hummed the air
and danced back and forth across the kitchen. “By
jing, that tune’s wonderful for the toddle!” he cried
exultantly. “We’ll make all Kernville step to it.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>“The point we want to hammer in is that we—the
Ward family—are the only people in Sycamore
county who are in touch with the Campbell power,
social and financial,” John elucidated to his friend
Townley. “Modest, retiring to the point of utter
self-effacement as we, the Wards, are, no other family
in the community has ever been honored by a visit
from so big a bunch of assets. And when it comes to
social prominence their coming will link Kernville
right on to Newport where old Walter Scott Campbell
owns one of the lordliest villas. Here’s a picture of
it I found in ‘Summer Homes of Great Americans.’
We’ll feed in the pictorial stuff from time to time,
using this photograph of Mrs. Campbell mother keeps
on the upright at home, and that cut of Walter Scott
I dug out of your office graveyard. Your record
shows you ran it the time the old money-devil was
indicted under the Sherman law for conspiracy against
the peace and dignity of the United States in a fiendish
attempt to boost the price of bathtubs. The indictment
was quashed as to the said Walter because he was
laid up with whooping cough when the wicked attack
on the free ablutions of the American people was planned
or concocted, and he denied all responsibility for the
acts of his proxy.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to hand it to that lad,” said Townley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
ruminatively. “Anything you can do to put me in
the way of a soft snap as private secretary for his
majesty would be appreciated. I’ve had considerable
experience in keeping my friends out of jail and I
might be of use to him.”</p>

<p>John rose early on Sunday morning to inspect his
handiwork in the section of the <i>Journal</i> devoted to the
goings and comings, the entertainments past and
prospective and the club activities of Kernville.
Townley had eliminated the usual group of portraits
of the brides of the week that Mrs. Walter Scott
Campbell’s handsome countenance might be spread
across three columns in the center of the page. The
photograph of Mrs. Campbell had been admirably
reproduced, and any one informed in such matters
would know instantly that she was the sort of woman
who looks well in evening gowns and that her pearl
necklace was of unquestionable authenticity.</p>

<p>The usual double column “lead” was devoted wholly
to the announcement of the visit of the Walter Scott
Campbells of New York and Newport to the Robert
Fleming Wards of Kernville, with all biographical
data necessary to establish the Campbells in the minds
of intelligent readers as persons of indubitable eminence
entitled to the most distinguished consideration in
every part of the world. Mrs. Campbell, John had
learned from “Distinguished American Women,” was
a Mayflower descendant, a Colonial Dame and a
Daughter of the Revolution, besides being a trustee of
eighteen separate and distinct philanthropies, and all
these matters were impressively set forth. Mr. Campbell’s
clubs in town and country required ten lines for
their recital. Any jubilation over the coming of so
much magnificence was neatly concealed under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
generalization that the horizon of Kernville was
rapidly widening and that there was bound to be more
and more communication between New York and
Kernville. Mrs. Ward, the article concluded, had
not yet decided in just what manner she would entertain
for the Campbells, but the representative people of
the city would undoubtedly have an opportunity to
meet her guests.</p>

<p>“The first gun is fired!” John whispered, thrusting
the paper through Helen’s bed-room door. “Read
and ponder well!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward read the announcement aloud at the
breakfast table as soberly as though it were a new
constitution for her favorite club.</p>

<p>“That Miss Givens who does the society news for
the <i>Journal</i> has more sense than I gave her credit for,”
she said. “There isn’t a word in that piece that isn’t
true. But that portrait of Ruth is a trifle too large;
you ought to have warned them about that! When
Tetrazzini sang here they didn’t print her picture half
as big as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, the <i>Journal</i> simply begged for a
photograph. People of note don’t mind publicity.
They simply eat it up!”</p>

<p>“Well, the article is really very nice,” said Mrs.
Ward, “but I hope they won’t say anything more until
the Campbells arrive.”</p>

<p>John, aware that several columns more bearing upon
the Campbell visit were already in type in the <i>Journal</i>
office, was grateful to Helen for changing the subject
to a pertinent discussion of the proper shade of wall
paper for the guest-room.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the <i>Journal’s</i> first page contained a
news-article on the crying need of enlarged railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
facilities, adroitly written to embody the hope of
the transportation committee of the Chamber of Commerce,
that when Mr. Walter Scott Campbell of the
board of directors of the Transcontinental paid his
expected visit to the city he would take steps to change
the reactionary policy of the road’s operating department.
The same article stated with apparent authority
that Robert Fleming Ward, the well-known attorney,
whose guest Mr. Campbell would be, had pledged
himself to assist the mayor and the Chamber of Commerce
to the utmost in urging Kernville’s needs upon
the great capitalist.</p>

<p>“See here, John, you’ve got to be careful about this
Campbell business!” Mr. Ward’s tone was severe.
“I know without your telling me you inspired that
piece in this morning’s paper. Campbell never saw me
in his life and that article gives the impression that he
and I are old cronies. It’s going to cause us all a lot
of embarrassment. It won’t do!”</p>

<p>“Sorry if it bothers you, father; but there’s nothing
untrue in that article. You’ll be the only man in
town who can get Campbell’s ear. If he refuses to
interest himself in a new freight house and that sort
of thing, that’s his affair.”</p>

<p>The stenographer knocked to announce Mr. Pickett.</p>

<p>“Say to him,” replied John, indifferently, “that we
are in conference but he can see us in just a moment.”</p>

<p>“Pickett!” exclaimed Ward, senior, as the door
closed. “What on earth brings him here!”</p>

<p>“The Campbells are coming,” replied John with a
grin. “Pickett’s president of the Water Power Company,
and he wants to line us up to get Campbell
interested in making a new bond deal.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Humph! If that’s what he wants I like his nerve.
We don’t even speak when we meet.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be speaking now! Let’s go out and give him
the glad hand of brotherly greeting.”</p>

<p>A little diffident at first, Wesley T. Pickett warmed
under the spell of the Wards’ magnanimity.</p>

<p>“I’ve regretted very much our little differences——”
he began.</p>

<p>“There’s no feeling on our side at all, Mr. Pickett,”
John declared and his father, a little dazed, murmured
his acquiescence in this view of the matter, and eyed
with interest a formidable bundle of documents in
Pickett’s hands.</p>

<p>“Fact is,” remarked Pickett, with a sheepish grin as
he re-crossed his legs, “you were dead right on that
matter of the pollution of the river. Swiggert probably
did the best he could with our defense but you were
right when you told me I’d save money and avoid
arousing hostile feeling in the community by pleading
guilty.”</p>

<p>“It’s always disagreeable to be obliged to tell a
man he hasn’t a good case,” Ward announced.</p>

<p>“Well, I want you to know I respect you for your
honesty. Swiggert encouraged me to think he might
get us off on some technical defect in the statute, and
it cost me a two thousand dollar fee to find he was
wrong.”</p>

<p>“The point he raised was an interesting one,”
Ward remarked mildly, “and he might have made it
stick.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t!” Pickett retorted a little savagely.
“Now I got a matter I want the God’s truth about,
absolutely. It’s a row I’ve got into with a few of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
stockholders in the glass company. The fools got the
idea of freezing me out! It’s all in these papers, and
I want you to give it all the time it needs, but I want
an opinion,—no more than you can get on a letter
sheet. Swiggert uses too many words and I’ve got to
have a yes or no.”</p>

<p>The thought of being frozen out caused Mr. Pickett
to swell with indignation. He turned from father to
son in an unvoiced but eloquent appeal to be saved from
so monstrous and impious an assault upon his dignity.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Pickett,” said the senior Ward,
accepting the papers. “We’ll be glad to take up the
matter. It’s possible I may have to ask some questions——”</p>

<p>“That will be all right, Ward! I don’t mind telling
you I’m a good deal worried about this thing. I’m
at the Elks Club most every noon, and if you’ll just
’phone when you’re ready to see me we can have
lunch together. Now, I guess a retainer’s the usual
thing. What do you say to a thousand or two?”</p>

<p>John with difficulty refrained from screaming that
two would be much more to the taste of the firm, but
his father’s gentle and slightly tremulous murmur that
one thousand would be satisfactory stilled him. The
check written with a flourish, lay on the edge of Ward
senior’s desk while Pickett abused the enemies who
were trying to wrest from him the control of the glass
company.</p>

<p>“I’m familiar with the general question you indicate,”
said Ward, senior; “I went into it a while back in a
similar case for a client in Newton county; we shall
give it our best attention.”</p>

<p>“I got confidence in you!” blurted Pickett. “That’s
why I brought the job here.” He thrust a big cigar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
into his mouth and began feeling in his pocket for a
match which John instantly supplied.</p>

<p>“Notice by the paper,” remarked Pickett, “that
Campbell of the Transcontinental’s comin’ out. If
you could arrange it, I’d like a chance to talk to him
about the Water Power bonds the Sutphen Trust’s
handled for us. I went to New York a couple of
weeks ago to see about refunding and I couldn’t get
near anybody but the fourth vice president. Wouldn’t
want to bother you, but if I could just get a chance at
Campbell and show him the plant——”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that can be arranged very easily,” John
answered quickly, noting a look of apprehension on his
father’s face. “It will be a pleasure to arrange a
meeting for you.”</p>

<p>“I’d particularly appreciate it,” said Pickett, shaking
hands with both of them; and John accompanied him
to the head of the stairway, where they shook hands
again.</p>

<p>“You don’t think,” asked Ward, senior, looking up
from Pickett’s papers, which he had already spread
out on his desk,—“you don’t really think the Campbells
had anything to do with this——”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, dad!” John replied gayly. “I’ll
just call up Helen and tell her to go ahead with the
redecorating and other things necessary to put our
house in order for royalty!”</p>

<p>John had deposited Pickett’s check and was crossing
the lobby of the Kernville National when he met
Jason V. Kirby leaving the officers’ corner.</p>

<p>“Hello, John!” exclaimed the brick manufacturer
affably. “Haven’t seen you round much of late.
Funny I ran into you; just going up to see you. You
know Taylor’s my lawyer, but he’s in Chicago trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
a long case, and I got an abstract of title I’m in a
hurry to have examined. Glad if you or your father
would pass on it. Farm I’m buying out in Decatur
township.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Kirby; we can give it immediate
attention,” John replied as though it were a common
occurrence for him to pick up business in this fashion.</p>

<p>To Kirby’s suggestion that if he didn’t mind he
might walk over to the brick company’s office and get
the abstract, John answered that he didn’t mind in
the least. The abstract was bulky, and John roughly
estimated that a report on it would be worth at least
a hundred dollars. Kirby explained that the land was
needed for the extension of the brick business and that
he had taken a ten-day option to keep a rival company
from picking it up.</p>

<p>“Look here, John,” remarked Kirby carelessly, as
John started off with the abstract in his pocket, “I see
that the Campbells are coming out to visit your folks.
Don’t let ’em overlook Kirby brick. We’re reachin’
right out for New York business.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Kirby. Father has it in mind to
take Mr. Campbell for an inspection of all our industries,
and I’ll give you the tip so you can be all set to
show off your plant.”</p>

<p>“Occurs to me Campbell might make a short speech
to our workmen; just a nice friendly jolly, you understand.”</p>

<p>“That will be perfectly simple, Mr. Kirby. Trust
me to arrange it.”</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>When John and his father reached home, Helen fell
upon her brother’s neck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“I’ve lost that wager! We’re invited!”</p>

<p>“Ah! The poison is at work, is it? Did it come
special post, or did their dusky Senegambian bear the
cards hither upon a golden plate?”</p>

<p>“Neither! Mrs. Kirby and Jeannette called and
left them personally. I was making bread when
they arrived but I had the presence of mind to shed
my apron on my way to the door to let them in.
Mother was darning socks but she came down and they
stayed so long the bread burned to a cinder.”</p>

<p>“A few loaves of bread are nothing—nothing!”</p>

<p>“But, John, dear, I think maybe——” began Mrs.
Ward, uncertainly and paused, noting that her husband
was emptying a satchel of important looking papers as
though he expected to spend the evening at work.
He appeared more cheerful than she had seen him in
years.</p>

<p>“Better let John have his way,” said Ward, senior.
“The Campbells are driving business into the office
and we’re not going to turn it away.”</p>

<p>“It’s your ability that’s bringing the business; you’ve
always been a bigger man than Taylor or Swiggert!”
declared Mrs. Ward, when the day’s events had been
explained to her.</p>

<p>“We’ll pretend that’s it anyhow,” Ward assented.
“There’s a mighty interesting question in that case of
Pickett’s. You may be sure I’m going to give it my
best care.”</p>

<p>“I’m so proud of you, Robert!”</p>

<p>“Be proud of John,” he laughed; “the boy’s bound to
make or ruin us in these next few weeks.”</p>

<p>It was astonishing the number of ways in which
the prospective visit of the Campbells became a matter
of deep concern to Kernville. Billy Townley had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
entered with zest into John’s campaign, and Martin
Cowdery, the owner of the <i>Journal</i> and the congressman
from the district, wired instructions from Washington
to cut things loose on the Campbell visit. Under
the same potent inspiration the <i>Journal’s</i> venerable
editorial writer took a vacation from his regular
business of explaining and defending the proprietor’s
failure to land a fish hatchery for the old Sycamore
district and celebrated the approach of the Campbells
under such captions as “The Dawn of a New Era,”
and “Stand up, Kernville.” He called loudly upon
the mayor, who was not of the <i>Journal’s</i> politics, to
clean the streets that their shameful condition might
not offend the eyes and the nostrils of the man of
millions who was soon to honor the city with his
presence.</p>

<p>The <i>Sun</i>, not to be outdone, boldly declared that
Campbell was coming to Kernville as the representative
of interests that were seeking an eligible site for a
monster steel casting plant, an imaginative flight that
precipitated a sudden call for a meeting of the Bigger
Kernville Committee of the Chamber of Commerce,
and the expenditure of fifteen dollars with war tax to
wire a set of resolutions to Walter Scott Campbell. A
five-line dispatch in the press report announcing that
Walter Scott Campbell had given half a million toward
the endowment of a hospital in Honolulu was handled
as a local item, quite as though Kernville alone vibrated
to Campbell’s generous philanthropies.</p>

<p>“Helen, we’ve got ’em going!” John chortled at the
beginning of the second week. “Three automobile
agents have offered me the biggest cars in their show
rooms to carry the Campbells hither and yon. I’m
encouraging competition for the honor. The Chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
of Commerce wants to give a banquet with speeches
and everything for our old friend Walter. Old man
Shepherd climbed our stairs today, risking apoplexy at
every step, to ask as a special favor that the Chamber
be granted this high privilege.”</p>

<p>“Ned’s asked me to go to the Kirby party with
him,” confessed Helen. “The embargo seems to be
off.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried John dramatically. “Mrs. Hovey called
me up to request my presence at dinner Wednesday
night. Alice has a friend visiting her. Alice with the
hair so soft and so brown, as stated in the ballad, is
the dearest girl in the world next to you, sis; no snobbery
about her; but her mama! Ah, mama has seen a
great light in the heavens!”</p>

<p>The population of Kernville was now divided into
two classes, those who would in all likelihood be permitted
to meet the Campbells, and those who could
hardly hope for this coveted privilege. The <i>Journal</i>
followed a picture of the Campbells’ Newport villa,
fortified with a glowing description of its magnificence,
with a counterfeit presentment of the <i>White Gull</i>,
which had almost the effect of anchoring the Campbells’
seagoing yacht in the muddy Sycamore at the
foot of Harrison street.</p>

<p>“The yacht’s the biggest thing we’ve pulled yet,”
John announced to Helen, a few days after the craft’s
outlines had been made familiar to the <i>Journal’s</i> constituency.
“Since we sprung it our office has drawn
four good cases, not including the collection business
of the Tilford Casket Company, which ought to be
good for a thousand bucks a year if the death rate in
the rich valley of the Sycamore doesn’t go down on us.”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful, John!” said Helen, in an awed tone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
“Mrs. Montgomery spent an hour with mother this
afternoon talking of the good old times, and how all
us old families must stand together, and she insisted
on throwing a tea for Mrs. Campbell—just for our old
friends—you know how she talks! She’d no sooner
rolled away than Mrs. Everett Crawford invaded our
home and interfered terribly with the paper hangers
while she begged to be allowed to give a dinner for
the Campbells in the new home they’ve built with
boodle they’ve made canning our native fruits.”</p>

<p>“Splendid! There may be some business there before
we get through with it! Young Freddie Crawford
is the gayest of our joy riders, and it would be worth a
big retainer to keep him out of the penal farm.”</p>

<p>A second stenographer had been established in the
office of Ward &amp; Ward to care for the increased business
when Cowdery left the halls of Congress for a
look at his fences, held conferences with John in an
upper room of the Kipperly House, sacred to political
conspiracy, and caused the <i>Journal</i> forthwith to launch
a boom for John Ward for prosecuting attorney subject
to the decision of the April primaries.</p>

<p>“Look here, little brother,” said Helen, coming in
from a dance to which Ned Shepherd had taken her,
and finding John in the sitting room at work on one
of the new cases that had been bestowed upon Ward
&amp; Ward, “we’ve got to put on brakes.”</p>

<p>“What’s troubling you, sis? Isn’t everybody treating
you all right?”</p>

<p>“A queen couldn’t receive more consideration! But
what’s worrying me is how we’re ever going to satisfy
these silly people. If all the plutocrats in New York
should come to visit us we couldn’t spread them around
in a way to please all our fellow townsmen. We’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
certainly in the lime light! People were buzzing me
tonight about the prosecutorship—say you’ll win in a
walk. But tell me what you think Cowdery’s going
to expect from you in return. Does he want to shake
the Campbell cherry tree?”</p>

<p>John eyed her with philosophical resignation.</p>

<p>“Now that you’ve been enfranchised by the Nineteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of this more or
less free republic, you must learn to view matters with
a mind of understanding. Cowdery hankers for a promotion
to the senate. If the accursed money interests
of the nation are persuaded that he is not a menace
to the angels of Wall street they can sow some seed
over the rich soil of this noble commonwealth
that will be sure to bear fruit. There’s a lot of Eastern
capital invested in the state and a word carelessly
spoken by the right persons, parties or groups in tall
buildings in New York and a substantial corruption
fund sent out from the same quarter will do much to
help Cowdery through the primary. In me, sweet
child, Cowdery sees a young man of great promise,
who can hitch the powerful Campbell to his wagon.”</p>

<p>“And if you can’t do the hitching——?”</p>

<p>“Been giving thought to that, sis. Those resolutions
the enterprising Bigger Kernville Committee sent
Campbell annoy me a great deal. We can only hope
that Walter has a sense of humor. The <i>Journal’s</i> got
a new untouched photograph of him from somewhere
and the boy looks cheerful. He has a triple chin and
there are lines around his eyes and mouth that argue
for a mirthful nature. The rest, dearest, is on the
knees of the gods!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was in the third week of Mr. John Marshall
Ward’s vigorous campaign of education that Walter
Scott Campbell, in his office in New York, tossed the
last of the letters he had been answering to his stenographer
and rang for his secretary.</p>

<p>A pale young man entered and waited respectfully
for the magnate to look up from the newspaper clippings
he was scanning.</p>

<p>“Parker, where the deuce did you get this stuff?”
Campbell asked.</p>

<p>“They came in our usual press clipping service.
Your order covers the better papers in the larger towns
where you have interests. It’s not often I find anything
worth showing you.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let me miss anything like this!” replied
Campbell with a chuckle.</p>

<p>He unfolded a page that had been sent complete,
being indeed the society page of the Kernville <i>Morning
Journal</i> of the previous Sunday. Campbell chuckled
again, much to the relief of the pale secretary, who
feared he might have brought to his employer’s attention
some news of evil omen. Campbell continued to
read, chuckling as he rapidly turned over the cuttings.</p>

<p>“You look a little run down, Parker,” he remarked
affably. “A change of air would do you good. Give
Miss Calderwood my calendar of appointments and
any data I may need in the next few days, and take
the first train for Kernville. Study this stuff carefully
and find out what it’s all about. There are some resolutions
from the Kernville Chamber of Commerce about
a site for a steel casting plant. Curious about that!
Must have been a leak somewhere. We discussed possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
locations in that secret conference at Pittsburgh
last week, but Kernville wasn’t mentioned. But that
town, with its water power, might possibly be just
right. Give it a looking over, but be very guarded in
all your inquiries. And learn all you can about these
Wards, father and son.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Campbell,” and Parker glanced at his
watch.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ward is an old friend of Mrs. Campbell—you
understand. There’s an old attachment and an
obligation, as I remember. Mrs. Ward was exceedingly
kind to Mrs. Campbell back in their school-days
when my wife was ill. She has never forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“My inquiries as to the Wards are to be made in
a sympathetic spirit? I understand, sir!”</p>

<p>“We are scheduled to stop at Kernville for a day
on our way to California—is that right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Campbell. Your car is ordered attached
to the Transcontinental Limited leaving at five twenty-one
on Tuesday, February seventeen.”</p>

<p>“Take several days to this investigation. Learn
what you can of these people, the town itself and so on.
All this whoop and hurrah out there is unusual. Most
amusing thing that’s turned up since they wanted me
to go out to some town in that neighborhood and preside
at a barbecue. What place was that?”</p>

<p>“Scottsburg, Indiana, during the campaign of 1916,”
replied the invaluable Parker.</p>

<p>“A great people, those of the Middle West,” remarked
Mr. Campbell reflectively. “As the phrase
goes, you’ve got to hand it to them. That’s all,
Parker.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elwell Parker had frequently played the role of
confidential investigator for Walter Scott Campbell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and established the following evening at the Kipperly
House he began his labors with his usual intelligence,
thoroughness and discretion. Within twenty-four hours
there was little pertaining to the Wards, the social or
business conditions of Kernville that he did not know.
Twenty-four hours more sufficed for his complete enlightenment
as to the thriving city’s advantages as a
manufacturing point, the value and possibilities of its
water power, and the financial and moral status of its
leading citizens. He thereupon wrote a report, condensed
it with faculties that had been trained in the
ways of Walter Scott Campbell, and then imparted it
by telephone to the magnate.</p>

<p>The famous Campbell chuckle rewarded the secretary
several times. The idea that the son of his wife’s
quondam schoolmate was shaking the foundations of
Kernville to bring the inhabitants to a realization of
the high condescension of the Walter Scott Campbells
in visiting their city with resulting benefits to the firm
of Ward &amp; Ward, tickled Walter Scott enormously.</p>

<p>“Very good, Parker! Come back at your convenience.
Subscribe for the local papers in your name.
We don’t want to overlook anything!”</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The Campbells’ visit was still ten days distant when
John, rising in the Sycamore Circuit Court to ask for
an injunction against certain persons who were removing
gravel from the pits of a company that had lately
carried its business to Ward &amp; Ward, was interrupted
by the bailiff who handed him a telegram.</p>

<p>“If your honor please——?” said John, bowing deferentially
toward the person of the court.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>The judge nodded, not a little impressed as the
young attorney tore open the envelope and scanned
the message, which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Have recommended your firm to certain
corporations in which I am interested to counsel
them in legal and business matters affecting
your city. Please feel no compulsion to accept
their commissions if not wholly agreeable to
you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">W. S. Campbell.</span></p>
</div>

<p>John thrust the message carelessly into his trousers’
pocket, straightened his shoulders and proceeded with
a terse explanation of the injury inflicted upon his
client and the grounds upon which he sought the immediate
relief of a restraining order.</p>

<p>The order was granted and in the midst of a parley
over the amount of bond to be given by the petitioner
the bailiff delivered into John’s hands three more
telegrams, one from the Sutphen Loan &amp; Trust Company,
another from The Ironsides Steel Casting Company,
another from the general manager of the Transcontinental
Lines west of Buffalo.</p>

<p>The message of the Sutphen Loan &amp; Trust Company
stated that it was sending an engineer to examine the
plant of the Sycamore Water Power Company and
would appreciate such confidential assistance as Ward
&amp; Ward might give him as to the personnel of the
corporation. One of the vice-presidents of the steel
casting company wished to make an appointment with
Ward &amp; Ward at the earliest date possible, letter of
explanation to follow; matter strictly confidential.
The Transcontinental official would reach Kernville
shortly to take up the matter of certain improvements,
and wished a conservative estimate of the local
needs uninfluenced by the Chamber of Commerce or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
owners of property that might be needed in extensions.
Matter confidential; letter to follow; please wire
answer.</p>

<p>Ward, senior, with law books overflowing upon the
floor from his desk, heard John’s report of his success
in protecting the gravel pits, read the telegrams, and
asked hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Are we crazy, John, or has the whole world gone
mad?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind! We’ve been discovered;
that’s all! Campbell’s a man of discernment, and he’s
spotted us as the solidest and most trustworthy citizens
and lawyers of the Sycamore valley. Though all
these messages are addressed to me, it’s the brains
of the firm he’s recommending and that’s you. I’m
only the field man and business getter.”</p>

<p>“You certainly get the business, son! Not
counting anything we may get out of those people
Campbell’s sending us, we’ve got at least twenty-five
thousand dollars’ worth of business on the books
right now!”</p>

<p>“Don’t look so scared, dad! We’re handling it all
right. Within a week I’ve turned down four divorce
cases and a breach of promise suit with love letters
I’d rejoice to read to a farmer jury! Pick and choose;
that’s our motto! Where are the papers in Shipton
versus Hovey. I’m getting a settlement there that will
save Hovey about ten thousand bucks, and I want to
tell him about it when I go up to see Alice tonight.
I’ll now wire our thanks to Campbell and date up
these people he’s sending to see us. Those wise guys
that run the Chamber of Commerce are going to be
frantic when they find the hope of a bigger Kernville
lies right here in our office.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>“I never expected a simple tea would cause so much
trouble!” exclaimed Mrs. Ward at the dinner table
five days before the day set for the Campbell visit.
“I’ve simply got to send out the cards tomorrow!”</p>

<p>“Let me see that list again,” said John. “It’s
first rate as it stands. You’ve put in all our new
clients and that’s the main thing. But if Mrs. Shepherd
is to pour chocolate, you’ll have to affix Mrs.
Hovey to the tea pot to prevent hard feeling. I’ve
got everything all set with Townley to make a big
spread of Helen’s engagement to Ned and mine to
Alice next Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t be too noisy about it,” pleaded Helen.
“Since you began boosting the family I’m ashamed to
look at the papers.”</p>

<p>“Circulation of both sheets has gone up, sis. Everybody
in the Sycamore valley’s on tip-toe for news of
the Wards and Campbells. Tomorrow the <i>Journal</i>
will print exclusive information from our office that
the mighty Ironsides corporation is to build a plant
here. The happy word that the railroad yards are
to be doubled and the shops enlarged will come from
headquarters, but father will be interviewed to make
sure we get the credit.”</p>

<p>“I think I understand everything,” said Helen
gazing musingly at the engagement ring of which she
had been the happy possessor for just twenty-four
hours, “except how Mr. Campbell began sending those
important people to you and father. You might
almost think it was a joke of some kind.”</p>

<p>“The joke certainly isn’t on us! I’ve decided to
turn down the nomination for prosecutor. As things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
are going I’d be a fool to sacrifice my private practice
for a public job. The general counsel of the Transcontinental’s
feeling us out as to whether we’ll take
the local attorneyship of that rascally corporation.
Canby Taylor’s had it for twenty years, and it would
be some triumph to add it to our string of scalps.”</p>

<p>The invitation list, rigidly revised and cut to one
hundred, was finally acceptable to all the members of
the family, and Helen and John had begun to address
the envelopes when this task was interrupted by the
delivery of a telegram.</p>

<p>“It’s for you, mother,” said Helen, taking the envelope
from the capped and aproned housemaid who
had been installed in the household against the coming
of the Campbells.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward adjusted her glasses and settled herself to
read with the resigned air of one inured to the idea
that telegrams are solely a medium for communicating
bad news.</p>

<p>“What is it, mother? Somebody dead?” asked
John without looking up from the envelope he was
addressing to The Hon. and Mrs. Addison Swiggert.</p>

<p>“Worse!” murmured Mrs. Ward, staring vacantly.</p>

<p>“Nothing can be worse!” ejaculated Helen, catching
the bit of paper as it fell fluttering to the floor. “The
Campbells are not coming!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Not coming!” faltered Robert Fleming Ward,
throwing down a brief he was studying.</p>

<p>“Read it, for heaven’s sake!” commanded John.</p>

<p>Helen, with difficulty bringing her eyes to meet the
dark tidings, began to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So sorry we are obliged to change our plans
and cannot pay you the visit to which we had
looked forward with so much pleasure——</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“It’s horrible! It’s positively tragic,” sobbed Mrs.
Ward, groping for her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Hurry on, Helen!” ordered John. “There’s a
lot more of it.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Walter feels that he ought to attend a conference
of Southern bankers unexpectedly called
for February eighteen at Baltimore, and we
are obliged to defer the California trip indefinitely.
However, we are going down in the
yacht and Walter has happily solved the
whole problem by insisting that you all come
to New York and make the cruise with us.</p>
</div>

<p>“Glory! glory hallelujah!” John shouted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The yacht is big enough to be comfortable
for even a poor sailor like me, so we can have
a cosy time together. We want your husband,
son and daughter to come of course, and you
will be our guests throughout the journey.
The Manager of the Transcontinental will put
his private car at your disposal. Do wire at
once that you will come. With much love.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ruth Campbell.</span></p>
</div>

<p>“Can you beat it! <i>Can</i> you beat it!” cried John.</p>

<p>“After all this talk—and the publicity and everything——”
his mother began plaintively.</p>

<p>“And all these people who’ve brought us business in
the hope of meeting the Campbells and getting favors
from him!” his father added hopelessly.</p>

<p>“My dear parents!” cried John pleadingly, flinging
up his arm with a dramatic gesture he had found effective
in commanding the attention of juries,—“my
<i>dear</i> parents, nothing could be more fortunate! If
the Campbells had come we’d have been hard put to
please all these people who want the joy of shaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
big money by the hand. The old boy very shrewdly
switched all these business matters to father and me
to handle so we’ve already got about everything Kernville
needs, and we’ve done it in a way that makes us
the best advertised law firm in the state.”</p>

<p>“But the humiliation——” his mother began in a
hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“Humiliation nothing!” John caught her up. “Don’t
you realize that an announcement that the Campbells
are sending a private car to haul us down to their
yacht will make the biggest hit of all! And you’re
going, mother—and you, Helen; and father’s got to
go, too! You all deserve it, and I’ll stay right here
and bask in the warm radiance of your grandeur while
the <i>White Gull</i> rides the waves.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, the change won’t ruin <i>everything</i>?”
his mother asked with a gulp.</p>

<p>“John’s perfectly right!” declared Helen. “The
Campbell name has already worked magic in our lives
and through us done wonders for Kernville. It will
be glorious to sail in a yacht! They didn’t need to
ask us, and nothing could be friendlier or more cordial
than that telegram.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” Mr. Ward assented. “But I can’t
possibly leave right now. There’s that Lindley coal
case coming up for trial next week, and John’s not
familiar with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear father, but when you ask for a postponement
on the perfectly legitimate ground that
Walter Scott Campbell wants you to go yachting with
him, that case will be set forward and you will acquire
much merit in the eyes of the court! You’ll need a
couple of white flannel suits and some rubber-soled
shoes, but you can pick them up in New York. Really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
this change of plans is the biggest thing of all. Take
this pad, mother, and write your acceptance, carefully
expressing my deep regret that owing to pressure of
professional duties I am unable to leave.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The announcement that Mr. and Mrs. Walter Scott
Campbell had been obliged to postpone their visit to
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Fleming Ward until spring,
but that Mr. and Mrs. Ward and Miss Helen were
to cruise with them in the <i>White Gull</i> did not fail of
the impression which John had predicted such a revelation
would make upon his fellow citizens. A yacht
that would sail the winter seas was a challenge to the
imagination of home-keeping folk whose most daring
adventure upon the deep was an occasional cruise
in an excursion steamer on the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Kernville was proud of the Wards, and so many citizens
of both genders expressed their affection with
flowers that the car in which the trio set out for New
York looked like a bridal bower.</p>

<p>Ned Shepherd and Alice Hovey were at the station
with John to see them off and several hundred other
citizens looked on with mingled emotions of admiration
and envy. The <i>Journal’s</i> photographer caught an
excellent picture of Mrs. Ward and Helen, their arms
full of roses, standing on the rear platform as the train
pulled out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“That boy of yours,” remarked Walter Scott Campbell,
as he sat with Robert Fleming Ward in the smoking
room of the <i>White Gull</i> as the yacht felt her way cautiously
up Chesapeake Bay,—“That boy must be a
good deal of a lad. Even at long range you can feel his
energy and enterprise.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“He’s a good boy,” Ward agreed diffidently, “and
full of ginger. I get out of breath trying to keep up
with him.”</p>

<p>Campbell chuckled. “Knows a chance when he
sees it.” Another Campbell chuckle. “I like youngsters
of that type. He’s profited of course by your
own long experience in the law?”</p>

<p>“He’s as good a lawyer as I am now—more resourceful,
and a better hand in dealing with people.”</p>

<p>“That boy knows more than the law,” declared
Campbell with another chuckle. “He knows human
nature!”</p>

<p>As their eyes met Ward’s face broke into a smile as
he realized that Campbell understood everything,
and was not at all displeased at the outrageous fashion
in which John had used his name.</p>

<p>“You know of Gaspard &amp; Collins, in New York?”
asked the magnate. “They do a good deal of my legal
work. They’re looking for a young man, westerner
preferred, to go into the firm, and it just occurs to me
that your John would just suit them. I can understand
how you would feel about losing him, but it’s a good
opportunity to get in touch with important affairs.
Talk it over with your wife, and if you think well of
the idea you can wire him tomorrow. It’s a fair night;
let’s go on deck and watch the lights.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ARABELLA’S HOUSE PARTY</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrington</span> read the note three times, fished the
discarded envelope out of his wastepaper basket,
scrutinized it thoroughly, and then addressed himself
again to the neat vertical script. What he read was
this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If Mr. Farrington will appear at the Sorona
Tea House, on Bayfield Road, near Corydon,
at four o’clock today—Tuesday—the
matter referred to in his reply to our advertisement
may be discussed. We serve only
one client at a time and our consultations
are all strictly confidential.</p>
</div>

<p>The note was unsigned, and the paper, the taste and
quality of which were beyond criticism, bore no address.
The envelope had not passed through the post office,
but had been thrust by a private messenger into the
R.F.D. box at Farrington’s gate.</p>

<p>Laurance Farrington had been established in the
Berkshires for a year, and his house in the hills back of
Corydon, with the Housatonic tumbling through his
meadow, had been much described in newspapers
and literary journals as the ideal home for a bachelor
author. He had remodeled an old farmhouse to conform
to his ideas of comfort, and incidentally he maintained
a riding horse, a touring car and a runabout;
and he had lately set up an Airedale kennel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>He was commonly spoken of as one of the most
successful and prosperous of American novelists.
He not only satisfied the popular taste but he was on
cordial terms with the critics. He was thirty-one,
and since the publication of The Fate of Catherine
Gaylord, in his twenty-fourth year, he had produced
five other novels and a score or more of short stories of
originality and power.</p>

<p>An enviable man was Laurance Farrington. When
he went back to college for commencement he shared
attention with presidents and ex-presidents; and governors
of states were not cheered more lustily. He
was considered a very eligible young man and he had
not lacked opportunities to marry. His friends marveled
that, with all his writing of love and marriage,
he had never, so far as any one knew, been in love or
anywhere near it.</p>

<p>As Farrington read his note in the quiet of his study
on this particular morning it was evident that his
good fortune had not brought him happiness. For
the first time he was finding it difficult to write. He
had begun a novel that he believed would prove to
be the best thing he had done; but for three months
he had been staring at blank paper. The plot he had
relied on proved, the moment he began to fit its parts
together, to be absurdly weak; and his characters had
deteriorated into feeble, spineless creatures over whom
he had no control. It was inconceivable that the
mechanism of the imagination would suddenly cease
to work, or that the gift of expression would pass from
him without warning; and yet this had apparently
happened.</p>

<p>Reading somewhere that Sir Walter Scott had
found horseback riding stimulating to the imagination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
he galloped madly every afternoon, only to return tired
and idealess; and the invitations of his neighbors to
teas and dinners had been curtly refused or ignored.
It was then that he saw in a literary journal this
advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Plots Supplied.</span> Authors in need of assistance
served with discretion. Address X Y
Z, care of office, <i>The Quill</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>To put himself in a class of amateurs requiring help
was absurd, but the advertisement piqued his curiosity.
Baker, the editor of The Quill, wrote him just then to
ask for an article on Tendencies in American Fiction;
and in declining this commission Farrington subjoined
a facetious inquiry as to the advertisement of X Y Z.
In replying, Baker said that copy for the ad had been
left at the business office by a stranger. A formal
note accompanying it stated that a messenger would
call later for answers.</p>

<p>“Of course,” the editor added jocularly, “this is only
another scheme for extracting money from fledgling
inkslingers—the struggling geniuses of Peoria and
Ypsilanti. You’re a lucky dog to be able to sit on
Olympus and look down at them.”</p>

<p>Farrington forced his unwilling pen to its task for
another week, hoping to compel the stubborn fountains
to break loose with their old abundance. His critical
faculties were malevolently alert and keen, now that
his creative sense languished. He hated what he
wrote and cursed himself because he could do no better.</p>

<p>To add to his torture, the advertisement in The
Quill recurred to him persistently, until, in sheer frenzy,
he framed a note to X Y Z—an adroit feeler, which he
hoped would save his face in case the advertisement
had not been put forth in good faith.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Plots—he wrote—were the best thing he did; and
as X Y Z seemed to be interested in the subject it
might be amusing if not indeed profitable for them to
meet and confer. This was the cheapest bravado;
he had not had a decent idea of any sort for a year!</p>

<p>X Y Z was nothing if not prompt. The reply,
naming the Sorona Tea House as a rendezvous, could
hardly have reached him sooner; and the fact that it had
been dipped into his mail box unofficially greatly
stimulated his interest.</p>

<p>The Sorona Tea House stood on a hilltop two miles
from Farrington’s home and a mile from Corydon, his
post office and center of supplies. It had been designed
to lure motorists to the neighborhood in the hope of
interesting them in the purchase of property. It was
off the main thoroughfares and its prosperity had
been meager; in fact, he vaguely remembered that
some one had told him the Sorona was closed. But
this was not important; if closed it would lend itself all
the better to the purposes of the conference.</p>

<p>He lighted his pipe and tramped over his fields with
his favorite Airedale until luncheon. It was good to
be out-doors; good to be anywhere, in fact, but nailed
to a desk. The brisk October air, coupled with the
prospect of finding a solution of his problems before
the day ended, brought him to a better mood, and he
sat down to his luncheon with a good appetite.</p>

<p>When three o’clock arrived he had experienced a
sharp reaction. He was sure he was making a mistake;
he was tempted to pack a suitcase and go for a weekend
with some friends on Long Island who had been teasing
him for a visit; but this would not be a decent way to
treat X Y Z, who might be making a long journey to
reach the tea house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>The question of X Y Z’s sex now became obtrusive.
Was the plot specialist man or woman? The handwriting
in the note seemed feminine and yet it might
have been penned by a secretary. The use of <i>our</i> and
<i>we</i> rather pointed to more than one person. Very
likely this person who offered plots in so businesslike
a fashion was a spectacled professor who had gone
through all existing fiction, analyzing devices and making
new combinations, and would prove an intolerable
bore—a crank probably; possibly an old maid who had
spent her life reading novels and was amusing herself
in her old age by furnishing novelists with ideas. He
smoked and pondered. He was persuaded that he
had made an ass of himself in answering the advertisement
and the sooner he was through with the business
the better.</p>

<p>He allowed himself an hour to walk to the Sorona,
and set off rapidly. He followed the road to the hilltop
and found the tea house undeniably there.</p>

<p>The place certainly had a forsaken look. The
veranda was littered with leaves, the doors and windows
were closed, and no one was in sight. Depression
settled on him as he noted the chairs and tables piled
high in readiness for storing for the winter. He
passed round to the western side of the house, and his
heart gave a thump as he beheld a table drawn close
to the veranda rail and set with a braver showing of
napery, crystal and silver than he recalled from his
few visits to the house in midsummer. A spirit lamp
was just bringing the kettle to the boiling point: it
puffed steam furiously. There were plates of sandwiches
and cakes, cream and sugar, and cups—two cups!</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Farrington! If you’re quite
ready let’s sit down.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>He started, turned round and snatched off his hat.</p>

<p>A girl had appeared out of nowhere. She greeted
him with a quick nod, as though she had known him
always—as though theirs was the most usual and
conventional of meetings. Then she walked to the
table and surveyed it musingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t trouble,” she said as he sprang forward
to draw out her chair. “Let us be quite informal;
and, besides, this is a business conference.”</p>

<p>Nineteen, he guessed—twenty, perhaps; not a day
more. She wore, well back from her face, with its
brim turned up boyishly, an unadorned black velvet
hat. Her hair was brown, and wisps of it had tumbled
down about her ears; and her eyes—they, too, were
brown—a golden brown which he had bestowed on
his favorite heroine. They were meditative eyes—just
such eyes as he might have expected to find in a
girl who set up as a plot specialist. There was a
dimple in her right cheek. When he had dimpled a
girl in a story he bestowed dimples in pairs. Now he
saw the superiority of the single dimple, which keeps
the interested student’s heart dancing as he waits for
its appearance. Altogether she was a wholesome and
satisfying young person, who sent scampering all his
preconceived ideas of X Y Z.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you were prompt! I always hate
waiting for people,” she said.</p>

<p>“I should always have hated myself if I had been
late,” he replied.</p>

<p>“A neat and courteous retort! You see the tea
house is closed. That’s why I chose it. Rather more
fun anyhow, bringing your own things.”</p>

<p>They were very nice things. He wondered how she
had got them there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“I hope,” he remarked leadingly, “you didn’t
have to bring them far!”</p>

<p>She laughed merrily at his confusion as he realized
that this was equivalent to asking her where she lived.</p>

<p>“Let’s assume that the fairies set the table. Do
you take yours strong?”</p>

<p>He delayed answering that she might poise the
spoonful of tea over the pot as long as possible. Hers
was an unusual hand; in his tales he had tried often
to describe that particular hand without ever quite
hitting it. He liked its brownness—tennis probably;
possibly she did golf too. Whatever sports she affected,
he was quite sure that she did them well.</p>

<p>“I knew you would like tea, for the people in your
novels drink such quarts; and that was a bully short
story of yours, The Lost Tea Basket—killingly funny—the
real Farrington cleverness!”</p>

<p>He blinked, knowing how dead the real Farrington
cleverness had become. Her manner was that of any
well-brought-up girl at a tea table, and her attitude
toward him continued to be that of an old acquaintance.
She took him as a matter of course; and though this
was pleasant, it shut the door on the thousand and one
questions he wished to ask her.</p>

<p>Just now she was urging him to try the sandwiches;
she had made them herself, she averred, and he need
not be afraid of them.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he suggested with an accession of courage,
“you won’t mind telling me your name.”</p>

<p>“It was nice of you to come,” she remarked dreamily,
ignoring his question, “without asking for credentials.
I’ll be perfectly frank and tell you that I couldn’t give
you references if you asked for them; you’re my first
client! I almost said patient!” she added laughingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“If you had said patient you would have made no
mistake! I’ve been out of sorts—my wits not working
for months.”</p>

<p>“I thought your last book sounded a little tired,”
she replied. “There were internal evidences of weariness.
You rather worked the long arm of coincidence
overtime, for example—none of your earlier bounce and
zest. Even your last short story didn’t quite get over—a
little too self-conscious probably; and the heroine
must have identified the hero the first time she saw him
in his canoe.”</p>

<p>She not only stated her criticisms frankly but she
uttered them with assurance, as though she had every
right to pass judgment on his performances. This
was the least bit irritating. He was slightly annoyed—as
annoyed as any man of decent manners dare be at
the prettiest girl who has ever brightened his horizon.
But this passed quickly.</p>

<p>Not only was she a pretty girl but he became conscious
of little graces and gestures, and of a charming
direct gaze, that fascinated him. And, for all her
youth, she was very wise; he was confident of that.</p>

<p>“I must tell you that though I had dozens of letters,
yours was the only one that appealed to me. A
majority of them were frivolous, and some were from
writers whose work I dislike. I had a feeling that if
they were played out they never would be missed.
But you were different; you are Farrington, and to
have you fail would be a calamity to American literature.”</p>

<p>He murmured his thanks. Her sympathetic tone
was grateful to his bruised spirit. He had gone too
far now to laugh away his appeal to her. And as the
moments passed his reliance on her grew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>They talked of the weather, the hills and the autumn
foliage, while he speculated as to her identity.</p>

<p>“Of course you know the Berkshires well, Miss——”</p>

<p>“A man who can’t play a better approach than that
certainly needs help!” she laughed.</p>

<p>He flushed and stammered.</p>

<p>“Of course I might have asked you directly if you
lived in the Hills. But let us be reasonable. I’m at
least entitled to your name; without that——”</p>

<p>“Without it you will be just as happy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you don’t mean that you won’t——”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I mean!” She smiled, her
elbows on the table, the slim brown fingers interlaced
under her firm rounded chin.</p>

<p>“That isn’t fair. You know me; and yet I’m utterly
in the dark as to you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, names are not of the slightest importance.
Of course X Y Z is rather awkward. Let’s find another
name—something you can call me by as a matter of
convenience if, indeed, we meet again.”</p>

<p>She bit into a macaroon dreamily while this took
effect.</p>

<p>“Not meet again!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course it’s possible we may not. We
haven’t discussed our business yet; but when we reach
it you may not care for another interview.”</p>

<p>“On a strictly social basis I can’t imagine myself
never seeing you again. As for my business, let it
go hang!”</p>

<p>She lifted a finger with a mockery of warning.</p>

<p>“No business, no more tea; no more anything!
You would hardly call the doctor or the lawyer merely
to talk about the scenery. And by the same token<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
you can hardly take the time of a person in my occupation
without paying for it.”</p>

<p>“But, Miss——”</p>

<p>“There you go again! Well, if you must have a
name, call me Arabella! And never mind about ‘Miss-ing’
me.”</p>

<p>“You’re the first Arabella I’ve ever known!” he
exclaimed fervidly.</p>

<p>“Then be sure I’m the last!” she returned mockingly;
then she laughed gayly. “Oh, rubbish! Let’s be
sensible. I have a feeling that the girls in your stories
are painfully stiff, and they’re a little too much alike.
They’re always just coming down from Newport or
Bar Harbor, and we are introduced to them as they
enter their marble palaces on Fifth Avenue and ring
for Walters to serve tea at once. You ought to cut
out those stately, impossible queens and go in for
human interest. I’ll be really brutal and say that
I’m tired of having your heroine pale slightly as her
lover—the one she sent to bring her an orchid known
only to a cannibal tribe of the upper Amazon—appears
suddenly at the door of her box at the Metropolitan,
just as Wolfram strikes up his eulogy of love in Tannhauser.
If one of the cannibals in his war dress should
appear at the box door carrying the lover’s head in a
wicker basket, that would be interesting; but for
Mister Lover to come wearing the orchid in his button-hole
is commonplace. Do you follow me?”</p>

<p>She saw that he flinched. No one had ever said
such things to his face before.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know the critics praise you for your wonderful
portrait gallery of women, but your girls don’t strike
me as being real spontaneous American girls. Do you
forgive me?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>He would have forgiven her if she had told him she
had poisoned his tea and that he would be a dead man
in five minutes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he remarked boldly, “the fact that I
never saw you until today will explain my failures!”</p>

<p>“A little obvious!” she commented serenely. “But
we’ll overlook it this time. You may smoke if you like.”</p>

<p>She lighted a match for him and held it to the tip
of his cigarette. This brought him closer to the
brown eyes for an intoxicating instant. Brief as that
moment was, he had detected on each side of her nose
little patches of freckles that were wholly invisible
across the table. He was ashamed to have seen them,
but the knowledge of their presence made his heart
go pitapat. His heart had always performed its physical
functions with the utmost regularity, but as a
center of emotions he did not know it at all. He must
have a care. Arabella folded her hands on the edge of
the table.</p>

<p>“The question before us now is whether you wish to
advise with me as to plots. Before you answer you
will have to determine whether you can trust me.
It would be foolish for us to proceed if you don’t think
I can help you. On the other hand, I can’t undertake
a commission unless you intrust your case to me fully.
And it wouldn’t be fair for you to allow me to proceed
unless you mean to go through to the end. My
system is my own; I can’t afford to divulge it unless
you’re willing to confide in me.”</p>

<p>She turned her gaze upon the gold and scarlet foliage
of the slope below, to leave him free to consider. He
was surprised that he hesitated. As an excuse for
tea-table frivolity this meeting was well enough; as a
business proposition it was ridiculous. But this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
unaccountable Arabella appealed strongly to his
imagination. If he allowed her to escape, if he told
her he had answered the advertisement of X Y Z
merely in jest, she was quite capable of telling him
good-by and slipping away into the nowhere out of
which she had come. No—he would not risk losing
her; he would multiply opportunities for conferences
that he might prolong the delight of seeing her.</p>

<p>“I have every confidence,” he said in a moment,
“that you can help me. I can tell you in a word the
whole of my trouble.”</p>

<p>“Very well, if you are quite sure of it,” she replied.</p>

<p>“The plain truth about me is,” he said earnestly—and
the fear he had known for days showed now in
his eyes——“the fact about me is that I’m a dead one!
I’ve lost my stroke. To be concrete, I’ve broken
down in the third chapter of a book I promised to
deliver in January, and I can’t drag it a line further!”</p>

<p>“It’s as clear as daylight that you’re in a blue funk,”
she remarked. “You’re scared to death. And that
will never do! You’ve got to brace up and cheer up!
And the first thing I would suggest is——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” he whispered eagerly.</p>

<p>“Burn those three chapters and every note you’ve
made for the book.”</p>

<p>“I’ve already burned them forty times!” he replied
ruefully.</p>

<p>“Burn them again. Then in a week, say, if you
follow my advice explicitly, it’s quite likely you’ll
find a new story calling you.”</p>

<p>“Just waiting won’t do it! I’ve tried that.”</p>

<p>“But not under my care,” she reminded him with
one of her enthralling smiles. “An eminent writer
has declared that there are only nine basic plots known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
to fiction; the rest are all variations. Let it be our
affair to find a new one—something that has never
been tried before!”</p>

<p>“If you could do that you’d save my reputation.
You’d pull me back from the yawning pit of failure!”</p>

<p>“Cease firing! You’ve been making hard work of
what ought to be the grandest fun in the world. The
Quill had a picture of you planted beside a beautiful
mahogany desk, waiting to be inspired. There’s not
much in this inspiration business. You’ve got to choose
some real people, mix them up and let them go to
it!”</p>

<p>“But,” Farrington frowned, “how are you ever
going to get them together? You can’t pick out the
interesting people you meet in the street and ask them
to work up a plot for you.”</p>

<p>“No,” she asserted, “you don’t ask them; you just
make them do it. You see”—taking up a cube of
sugar and touching it to the tip of her tongue—“every
living man and woman, old or young, is bitten with the
idea that he or she is made for adventure.”</p>

<p>“Rocking-chair heroes,” he retorted, “who’d cry
if they got their feet wet going home from church!”</p>

<p>“The tamer they are, the more they pine to hear
the silver trumpet of romance under their windows,”
she replied, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p>He was growing deeply interested. She was no
ordinary person, this girl.</p>

<p>“I see one obstacle,” he replied dubiously. “Would
you mind telling me just how you’re going to effect
these combinations—assemble the parts, so to speak;
or, in your more poetical manner, make the characters
harken to the silver horn?”</p>

<p>“That,” she replied readily, “is the easiest part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
all! You’ve already lost so much time that this is an
emergency case and we’ll call them by telegraph!”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that—not really!”</p>

<p>“Just that! We’ll have to decide what combination
would be the most amusing. We should want to bring
together the most utterly impossible people—people
who’d just naturally hate each other if they were left
in the same room. In that way you’d quicken the
action.”</p>

<p>He laughed aloud at the possibilities; but she went
on blithely:</p>

<p>“We ought to have a person of national distinction—a
statesman preferred; some one who figures a lot
in the newspapers. Let’s begin,” she suggested,
“with the person in all the United States who has the
least sense of humor.”</p>

<p>“The competition would be keen for that honor,”
said Farrington, “but I suggest the Honorable Tracy
B. Banning, the solemnest of all the United States
senators—Idaho or Rhode Island—I forget where he
hails from. It doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“I hoped you’d think of him,” she exclaimed, striking
her hands together delightedly.</p>

<p>“He owns a house—huge, ugly thing—on the other
side of Corydon.”</p>

<p>“Um! I think I’ve heard of it,” she replied indifferently.</p>

<p>She drew from her sweater pocket and spread on the
table these articles: a tiny vanity box, a silver-backed
memorandum book, two caramels and the stub of a lead-pencil.
There was a monogram on the vanity box, and
remembering this she returned it quickly to her pocket.
He watched her write the Senator’s name in her book,
in the same vertical hand in which the note making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the appointment had been written. She lifted her
head, narrowing her eyes with the stress of thought.</p>

<p>“If a man has a wife we ought to include her, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Farrington threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>“Seems to me his wife’s divorcing him—or the other
way round. The press has been featuring them lately.”</p>

<p>“Representative of regrettable tendency in American
life,” she murmured. “They go down as Mr. and
Mrs.”</p>

<p>“Now it’s your turn,” he said.</p>

<p>“Suppose we put in a gay and cheerful character
now to offset the Senator. I was reading the other
day about the eccentric Miss Sallie Collingwood, of
Portland, Maine; she’s rich enough to own a fleet of
yachts, but she cruises up and down the coast in a
disreputable old schooner—has a mariner’s license
and smokes a pipe. Is she selected?”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe there’s anybody so worth while on
earth!”</p>

<p>“That’s your trouble!” she exclaimed, as she wrote
the name. “Your characters never use the wrong
fork for the fish course; they’re all perfectly proper
and stupid. Now it’s your turn.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” he suggested, “that you ought
to name all the others. As I think of it, I really don’t
know any interesting people. You’re right about
the tameness of my characters, and my notebooks are
absolutely blank.”</p>

<p>She merely nodded.</p>

<p>“Very well; I suppose it’s only fair for me to supply
the rest of the eggs for the omelet. Let me see; there’s
been a good deal in the papers about Birdie Coningsby,
the son of the copper king, one of the richest young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
men in America. I’ve heard that he has red hair, and
that will brighten the color scheme.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” murmured Farrington. “He was arrested
last week for running over a traffic cop in New
Jersey. I judge that the adventurous life appeals to
him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose our Senator represents the state; the
church also should be represented. Why not a clergyman
of some sort? A bishop rather appeals to me;
why not that Bishop of Tuscarora who’s been warning
New York against its sinful ways?”</p>

<p>“All right. He’s at least a man of courage; let’s
give him a chance.”</p>

<p>“A detective always helps,” Arabella observed
meditatively.</p>

<p>“Then by all means put in Gadsby! I’m tired of
reading of his exploits. I think he’s the most conceited
ass now before the public.”</p>

<p>“Gadsby is enrolled!”</p>

<p>She held up the memorandum for his inspection.</p>

<p>“That’s about enough to start things,” she remarked.
“It’s a mistake to have too many characters in a novel.
Of course others may be drawn in—we can count on
that.”</p>

<p>“But the heroine—a girl that realizes America’s
finest and best——”</p>

<p>“I think she should be the unknown quantity—left
up in the air. But if you don’t agree with that——”</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” he said, meeting her eyes, “that
possibly you——”</p>

<p>One of her most charming smiles rewarded this.</p>

<p>“As the chief plotter, I must stand on the sidelines
and keep out of it. But if you think——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“I think,” he declared, “that the plot would be a
failure if you weren’t in it—very much in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we must pass that. But there might be a
girl of some sort. What would you think of Zaliska?”</p>

<p>“The dancer! To offset the bishop!”</p>

<p>The mirth in her eyes kindled a quick response in
his. She laughingly jotted down the name of the
Servian dancer who had lately kicked her way into
fame on Broadway.</p>

<p>“But do you think,” he interposed, “that the call
of the silver horn is likely to appeal to her? She’d
need a jazz band!”</p>

<p>“Oh, variety is the spice of adventure! We’ll give
her a chance,” she answered. “I think we have done
well. One name more needs to be inscribed—that of
Laurance Farrington.”</p>

<p>She lifted her hand quickly as he demurred.</p>

<p>“You need experiences—adventures—to tone up
your imagination. Perhaps Zaliska will be your fate;
but there’s always the unknown quantity.”</p>

<p>They debated this at length. He insisted that he
would be able to contribute nothing to the affair; that
it was his lack of ideas which had caused him to appeal
to her for help, and that it would be best for him to
act the role of interested spectator.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but your objections don’t impress me,
Mr. Farrington. If you’re not in the game you won’t
be able to watch it in all its details. So down you go!”</p>

<p>For a moment she pondered, with a wrinkling of her
pretty brows, the memorandum before her; then she
closed the book and dropped it into her sweater pocket.
He was immensely interested in her next step, wondering
whether she really meant to bring together the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
widely scattered and unrelated people she had selected
for parts in the drama that was to be enacted for his
benefit.</p>

<p>She rose so quickly that he was startled, gave a
boyish tug at her hat—there was something rather
boyish about her in spite of her girlishness—and said
with an air of determination:</p>

<p>“How would Thursday strike you for the first rehearsal?
Very well, then. There may be some difficulty
in reaching all of them by telegraph; but that’s my
trouble. Just where to hold the meeting is a delicate
question. We should have”—she bent her head for
an instant—“an empty house with large grounds;
somewhere in these hills there must be such a place.
You know the country better than I. Maybe——”</p>

<p>“To give a house party without the owner’s knowledge
or consent is going pretty far; there might be
legal complications,” he suggested seriously.</p>

<p>“Timidity doesn’t go in the adventurous life. And
besides,” she added calmly, “that matter doesn’t
concern us in the least. If they all get arrested it’s
so much the better for the plot. We can’t hope for
anything as grand as that!”</p>

<p>“But how about you! What if you should be discovered
and go to jail! Imagine my feelings!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re not to worry about me. That’s my
professional risk.”</p>

<p>“Then, as to the place, what objection is there to
choosing Senator Banning’s house? He’s in the cast
anyhow. His place, I believe, hasn’t been occupied for
a couple of years. The gates were nailed up the last
time I passed there.”</p>

<p>She laughed at this suggestion rather more merrily
than she had laughed before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“That’s a capital idea! Particularly as we’ve chosen
him for his lack of humor!”</p>

<p>“If he has any fun in him he’ll have a chance to
show it,” said Farrington, “when he finds his house
filled with people he never saw before.”</p>

<p>Questions of taste as to this procedure, hanging
hazily at the back of his consciousness, were dispelled
by Arabella’s mirthful attitude toward the plan. He
could hardly tell this joyous young person that it would
be transcending the bounds of girlish naughtiness to
telegraph a lot of people she didn’t know to meet at
the house of a gentleman who enjoyed national fame
for his lack of humor. Arabella would only laugh at
him. The delight that danced in her eyes was infectious
and the spirit of adventure possessed him. He was
impatient for the outcome: still, would she—dared she—do
it?</p>

<p>She had drawn on a pair of tan gloves and struck
her hands together lightly.</p>

<p>“This has been the nicest of little parties! I thank
you—the first of my clients! But I must skip!”</p>

<p>He had been dreading the moment when she might
take it into her head to skip. They had lingered long
and the sun had dropped like a golden ball beyond the
woodland.</p>

<p>“But you will let me help with the tea things?” he
cried eagerly. “I can telephone from the crossroads
for my machine.”</p>

<p>She ignored his offer. A dreamy look came into her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she said with the air of a child proposing
a new game, “whether anyone’s ever written a story
about a person—man or girl—who undertakes to find
some one; who seeks and seeks until it’s a puzzling and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
endless quest—and then finds that the quarry is himself—or
herself! Do you care for that? Think it over. I
throw that in merely as a sample. We can do a lot
better than that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must put it in the bill!”</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, “please, when you leave, don’t
look back; and don’t try to find me! In this business
who seeks shall never find. We place everything on the
knees of the gods. Thursday evening, at Mr. Banning’s,
at eight o’clock. Please be prompt.”</p>

<p>Then she lifted her arms toward the sky and cried
out happily:</p>

<p>“There, sir, is the silver trumpet of romance! I
make you a present of it.”</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to the faint outline of the new
moon that shone clearly through the tremulous dusk.</p>

<p>As he looked she placed her hands on the veranda
railing and vaulted over it so lightly that he did not
know she had gone until he heard her laughing as she
sprang away and darted through the shrubbery below.</p>

<p>From the instant Arabella disappeared Farrington
tortured himself with doubts. One hour he believed
in her implicitly; the next he was confident that she had
been playing with him and that he would never see her
again.</p>

<p>He rose early Wednesday morning and set out in
his runabout—a swift scouring machine—and covered
a large part of Western Massachusetts before nightfall.
Somewhere, he hoped, he might see her—this amazing
Arabella, who had handed him the moon and run away!
He visited the tea house; but every vestige of their
conference had been removed. He was even unable to
identify the particular table and chairs they had used.
He drove to the Banning place, looked at the padlocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
gates and the heavily shuttered windows, and hurried
on, torn again by doubts. He cruised slowly through
villages and past country clubs where girls adorned the
landscape, hoping for a glimpse of her. It was the
darkest day of his life, and when he crawled into bed
at midnight he was seriously questioning his own
sanity.</p>

<p>A storm fell on the hills in the night and the fateful
day dawned cold and wet. He heard the rain on his
windows gratefully. If the girl had merely been making
sport of him he wanted the weather to do its worst. He
cared nothing for his reputation now; the writing of
novels was a puerile business, better left to women
anyhow. The receipt of three letters from editors asking
for serial rights to his next book enraged him.
Idiots, not to know that he was out of the running
forever!</p>

<p>He dined early, fortified himself against the persistent
downpour by donning a corduroy suit and a
heavy mackintosh, and set off for the Banning place at
seven o’clock. Once on his way he was beset by a fear
that he might arrive too early. As he was to be a
spectator of the effects of the gathering, it would be
well not to be first on the scene. As he passed through
Corydon his engine changed its tune ominously and he
stopped at a garage to have it tinkered. This required
half an hour, but gave him an excuse for relieving his
nervousness by finishing the run at high speed.</p>

<p>A big touring car crowded close to him, and in response
to fierce honkings he made way for it. His
headlights struck the muddy stern of the flying car and
hope rose in him. This was possibly one of the adventurers
hastening into the hills in response to Arabella’s
summons. A moment later a racing car, running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
like an express train, shot by and his lamps played on
the back of the driver huddled over his wheel.</p>

<p>When he neared the Banning grounds Farrington
stopped his car, extinguished the lights and drove it in
close to the fence.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight-thirty and the danger of being
first had now passed. As he tramped along the muddy
road he heard, somewhere ahead, another car, evidently
seeking an entrance. Some earlier arrival had opened
the gates, and as he passed in and followed the curving
road he saw that the house was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p>As he reached the steps that led up to the broad
main entrance he became panic-stricken at the thought
of entering a house the owner of which he did not know
from Adam, on an errand that he felt himself incapable
of explaining satisfactorily. He turned back and was
moving toward the gates when the short, burly figure
of a man loomed before him and heavy hands fell on
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” said Farrington breathlessly.
An electric lamp flashed in his face, mud-splashed from
his drive, and his captor demanded his business. “I
was just passing,” he faltered, “and I thought perhaps——”</p>

<p>“Well, if you thought perhaps, you can just come up
to the house and let us have a look at you,” said the
stranger gruffly.</p>

<p>With a frantic effort Farrington wrenched himself
free; but as he started to run he was caught by the
collar of his raincoat and jerked back.</p>

<p>“None of that now! You climb right up to the house
with me. You try bolting again and I’ll plug you.”</p>

<p>To risk a bullet in the back was not to be considered
in any view of the matter, and Farrington set off with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
as much dignity as he could assume, his collar tightly
gripped by his captor.</p>

<p>As they crossed the veranda the front door was
thrown open and a man appeared at the threshold.
Behind him hovered two other persons.</p>

<p>“Well, Gadsby, what have you found?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Farrington’s captor with elation,
“that we’ve got the man we’re looking for!”</p>

<p>Farrington was thrust roughly through the door and
into a broad, brilliantly lighted hall.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Senator Banning was one of the most generously
photographed of American statesmen, and the bewildered
and chagrined Farrington was relieved to find his
wits equal to identifying him from his newspaper
pictures.</p>

<p>“Place your prisoner by the fireplace, where we can
have a good look at him,” the Senator ordered. “And,
if you please, Gadsby, I will question him myself.”</p>

<p>Rudely planted on the hearth, Farrington stared
about him. Two of the persons on Arabella’s list had
answered the summons at any rate. His eyes ran over
the others. A short, stout woman, wearing mannish
clothes and an air of authority, advanced and scrutinized
him closely.</p>

<p>“A very harmless person, I should say,” she commented;
and, having thus expressed herself sonorously,
she sat down in the largest chair in the room.</p>

<p>The proceedings were arrested by a loud chugging
and honking on the driveway.</p>

<p>Farrington forgot his own troubles now in the lively
dialogue that followed the appearance on the scene of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
a handsome middle-aged woman, whose face betrayed
surprise as she swept the room with a lorgnette for an
instant, and then, beholding Banning, showed the keenest
displeasure.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know,” she demanded, “the precise
meaning of this! If it’s a trick—a scheme to compromise
me—I’d have you know, Tracy Banning, that
my opinion of you has not changed since I bade you
farewell in Washington last April.”</p>

<p>“Before we proceed farther,” retorted Senator Banning
testily, “I should like to ask just how you came
to arrive here at this hour!”</p>

<p>She produced a telegram from her purse. “Do you
deny that you sent that message, addressed to the
Gassaway House at Putnam Springs? Do you suppose,”
she demanded as the Senator put on his glasses
to read the message, “that I’d have made this journey
just to see you?”</p>

<p>“Arabella suffering from nervous breakdown; meet
me at Corydon house Thursday evening,” read the
Senator.</p>

<p>“Arabella ill!” exclaimed the indomitable stout
lady. “She must have been seized very suddenly!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen Arabella and I never sent you this
telegram,” declared the Senator. “I was brought here
myself by a fraudulent message.” He drew a telegram
from his pocket and read impressively:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Arabella has eloped. Am in pursuit. Meet
me at your house in Corydon Thursday evening.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Sallie Collingwood.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The stout lady’s vigorous repudiation of this telegram
consumed much time, but did not wholly appease the
Senator. He irritably waved her aside, remarking
sarcastically:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“It seems to me, Sallie Collingwood, that your presence
here requires some explanation. I agreed to give
you the custody of Arabella while Frances and I were
settling our difficulties, because I thought you had wits
enough to take care of her. Now you appear to have
relinquished your charge, and without giving me any
notice whatever. I had supposed, even if you are my
wife’s sister, that you would let no harm come to my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“I’ll trouble you, Tracy Banning, to be careful how
you speak to me!” Miss Collingwood replied. “Poor
Arabella was crushed by your outrageous behavior, and
if any harm has come to her it’s your fault. She remained
with me on the <i>Dashing Rover</i> for two weeks;
and last Saturday, when I anchored in Boston Harbor to
file proceedings against the captain of a passenger boat
who had foully tried to run me down off Cape Ann, she
ran away. Last night a telegram from her reached me
at Beverly saying you were effecting a reconciliation
and asking me to be here tonight to join in a family
jollification. Meantime I had wired to the Gadsby
Detective Agency to search for Arabella and asked them
to send a man here.”</p>

<p>“Reconciliation,” exploded the lady with the lorgnette,
“has never been considered! And if I’ve been
brought here merely to be told that you have allowed
Arabella to walk off your silly schooner into the Atlantic
Ocean——”</p>

<p>“You may as well calm yourself, Frances. There’s no
reason for believing that either Tracy or I had a thing
to do with this outrage.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bishop Giddings is with me; he, too, has been
lured here by some one. We met on the train quite by
chance and I shall rely on his protection.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>A black-bearded gentleman, who had followed Mrs.
Banning into the hall and quietly peeled off a raincoat,
was now disclosed in the garb of a clergyman—the
Bishop of Tuscarora, Farrington assumed. He viewed
the company quizzically, remarking:</p>

<p>“Well, we all seem to be having a good time!”</p>

<p>“A great outrage has been perpetrated on us,”
trumpeted the Senator. “I’m amazed to see you here,
Bishop. Some lawless person has opened this house and
telegraphed these people to come here. When I found
Gadsby on the premises I sent him out to search the
grounds; and I strongly suspect”—he deliberated and
eyed Farrington savagely—“that the culprit has been
apprehended.”</p>

<p>A young man with fiery red hair, who had been nervously
smoking a cigarette in the background, now made
himself audible in a high piping voice:</p>

<p>“It’s a sell of some kind, of course. And a jolly
good one!”</p>

<p>This provoked an outburst of wrath from the whole
company with the exception of Farrington, who leaned
heavily on the mantel in a state of helpless bewilderment.
These people seemed to be acquainted; not
only were they acquainted but they appeared to be
bitterly hostile to one another.</p>

<p>Mrs. Banning had wheeled on the red-haired young
man, whom Farrington checked off Arabella’s list as
Birdie Coningsby, and was saying imperiously:</p>

<p>“Your presence adds nothing to my pleasure. If
anything could increase the shame of my summons
here you most adequately supply it.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mrs. Banning,” he pleaded; “but it’s
really not my fault. When Senator Banning telegraphed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
asking me to arrive here tonight for a weekend
I assumed that it meant that Arabella——”</p>

<p>“Before we go further, Tracy Banning,” interrupted
the Senator’s wife, “I want to be sure that your intimacy
with this young scamp has ceased and that this
is not one of your contemptible tricks to persuade me
that he is a suitable man for my child to marry. After
all the scandal we suffered on account of that landgrab
you were mixed up in with old man Coningsby, I
should think you’d stop trying to marry his son to my
poor, dear Arabella!”</p>

<p>The Bishop of Tuscarora planted a chair behind
Mrs. Banning just in time to save her from falling to
the floor.</p>

<p>“Somebody has played a trick on all of us,” said
the detective. “My message was sent to my New
York office and said that the Senator wished to see me
here on urgent business. I got that message an hour
after Miss Collingwood’s and I have six men looking
for the lost girl.”</p>

<p>They compared notes with the result that each
telegram was found to have been sent from a different
railroad station between Great Barrington and Pittsfield.
While this was in progress Farrington felt quite
out of it and planned flight at the earliest moment.
He pricked up his ears, however, as, with a loud laugh,
the Bishop drew out his message and read it with
oratorical effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Adventure waits! Hark to the silver bugle!
Meet me at Tracy Banning’s on Corydon
Road via Great Barrington at eight o’clock
Thursday evening.</p>

<p class="right">X Y Z.</p>
</div>

<p>Farrington clung to the mantel for physical and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
mental support. His mind was chaos; the Stygian
Pit yawned at his feet. Beyond doubt, his Arabella
of the tea table had dispatched messages to all the
persons on her list; and, in the Bishop’s case at least,
she had given the telegram her own individual touch.
No wonder they were paying no attention to him; the
perspiration was trailing in visible rivulets down his
mud-caked face and his appearance fully justified their
suspicions.</p>

<p>“All my life,” the Bishop of Tuscarora was explaining
good-humoredly, “I have hoped that adventure would
call me some day. When I got that telegram I heard
the bugles blowing and set off at once. Perhaps if I
hadn’t known Senator Banning for many years, and
hadn’t married him when I was a young minister,
I shouldn’t have started for his house so gayly. Meeting
Mrs. Banning on the train and seeing she was in
great distress, I refrained from showing her my summons.
How could I? But I’m in the same boat with
the rest of you—I can’t for the life of me guess why
I’m here.”</p>

<p>Farrington had been slowly backing toward a side
door, with every intention of eliminating himself from
the scene, when a heavy motor, which had entered the
grounds with long, hideous honks, bumped into the
entrance with a resounding bang, relieved by the
pleasant tinkle of the smashed glass of its windshield.</p>

<p>Gadsby, supported by the agile Coningsby, leaped
to the door; but before they could fortify it against
attack it was flung open and a small, light figure landed
in the middle of the room, and a young lady, a very
slight, graceful young person in a modish automobile
coat, stared at them a moment and then burst out
laughing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Zaliska!” screamed Coningsby.</p>

<p>“Well,” she cried, “that’s what I call some entrance!
Lordy! But I must be a sight!”</p>

<p>She calmly opened a violet leather vanity box, withdrew
various trifles and made dexterous use of them,
squinting at herself in a mirror the size of a silver
dollar.</p>

<p>Farrington groaned and shuddered, but delayed his
flight to watch the effect of this last arrival.</p>

<p>Banning turned on Coningsby and shouted:</p>

<p>“This is your work! You’ve brought this woman
here! I hope you’re satisfied with it!”</p>

<p>“My work!” piped Coningsby very earnestly in his
queer falsetto. “I never had a thing to do with it;
but if Zaliska is good enough for you to dine with in
New York it isn’t square for you to insult her here
in your own house.”</p>

<p>“I’m not insulting her. When I dined with her it
was at your invitation, you little fool!” foamed the
Senator.</p>

<p>Zaliska danced to him on her toes, planted her tiny
figure before him and folded her arms.</p>

<p>“Be calm, Tracy; I will protect you!” she lisped
sweetly.</p>

<p>“Tracy! Tracy!” repeated Mrs. Banning.</p>

<p>Miss Collingwood laughed aloud. She and the
Bishop seemed to be the only persons present who
were enjoying themselves. Outside, the machine
that had brought Zaliska had backed noisily off the
steps and was now retreating.</p>

<p>“Oh, cheer up, everybody!” said Zaliska, helping
herself to a chair. “My machine’s gone back to town;
but I only brought a suitcase, so I can’t stay forever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
By the way, you might bring it in, Harold,” she
remarked to Coningsby with a yawn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Banning alone seemed willing to cope with her.</p>

<p>“If you are as French as you look, mademoiselle, I
suppose——”</p>

<p>“French, ha! Not to say aha! I sound like a
toothpaste all right, but I was born in good old Urbana,
Ohio. Your face registers sorrow and distress, madam.
Kindly smile, if you please!”</p>

<p>“No impertinence, young woman! It may interest
you to know that the courts haven’t yet freed me of the
ties that bind me to Tracy Banning, and until I get
my decree he is still my husband. If that has entered
into your frivolous head kindly tell me who invited
you to this house.”</p>

<p>The girl pouted, opened her vanity box, and
slowly drew out a crumpled bit of yellow paper, which
she extended toward her inquisitor with the tips of her
fingers.</p>

<p>“This message,” Mrs. Banning announced, “was
sent from Berkville Tuesday night.” And then her
face paled. “Incredible!” she breathed heavily.</p>

<p>Gadsby caught the telegram as it fluttered from her
hand.</p>

<p>“Read it!” commanded Miss Collingwood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Helene Zaliska</span>,<br />
 &#160; &#160; New Rochelle, N. Y.<br />
</p>

<p>Everything arranged. Meet me at Senator
Banning’s country home, Corydon, Massachusetts,
Thursday evening at eight.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Alembert Giddings</span>, &#160; &#160; <br />
<i>Bishop of Tuscarora.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The Bishop snatched the telegram from Gadsby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and verified the detective’s reading with unfeigned
astonishment. The reading of this message evoked
another outburst of merriment from Miss Collingwood.</p>

<p>“Zaliska,” fluted young Coningsby, “how dare
you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never take a dare,” said Zaliska. “I guessed
it was one of your jokes; and I always thought it
would be real sporty to be married by a bishop.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miss Collingwood frigidly, “I suppose
you’ve tried everything else!”</p>

<p>The Bishop met Mrs. Banning’s demand that he
explain himself with all the gravity his good-natured
countenance could assume.</p>

<p>“It’s too deep for me. I give it up!” he said.
He crossed to Zaliska and took her hand.</p>

<p>“My dear young woman, I apologize as sincerely as
though I were the guilty man. I never heard of you
before in my life; and I wasn’t anywhere near Berkville
day before yesterday. The receipt of my own telegram
in New Hampshire at approximately the same hour
proves that irrefutably.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be all right, Bishop,” said Zaliska.
“I’m just as pleased as though you really sent it.”</p>

<p>Miss Collingwood had lighted her pipe—a performance
that drew from Zaliska an astonished:</p>

<p>“Well, did you ever! Gwendolin, what have we
here?”</p>

<p>“What I’d like to know,” cried Mrs. Banning,
yielding suddenly to tears, “is what you’ve done with
Arabella!”</p>

<p>The mention of Arabella precipitated a wild fusillade
of questions and replies. She had been kidnapped,
Mrs. Banning charged in tragic tones, and Tracy
Banning should be brought to book for it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“You knew the courts would give her to me and it
was you who lured her away and hid her. This
contemptible little Coningsby was your ideal of a
husband for Arabella, to further your own schemes
with his father. I knew it all the time! And you
planned to meet him here, with this creature, in your
own house! And he’s admitted that you’ve been
dining with her. It’s too much! It’s more than I
should be asked to suffer, after all—after all—I’ve—borne!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Mrs. Lady; creature is a name I won’t
stand for!” flamed Zaliska.</p>

<p>“If you’ll all stop making a rotten fuss——” wheezed
Coningsby.</p>

<p>“If we can all be reasonable beings for a few minutes——”
began the Bishop.</p>

<p>Before they could finish their sentences Gadsby
leaped to the doorway, through which Farrington was
stealthily creeping, and dragged him back.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the detective, depositing
Farrington, cowed and frightened, in the center of the
group, which closed tightly about him, “that it’s about
time this bird was giving an account of himself.
Everybody in the room was called here by a fake telegram,
and I’m positive this is the scoundrel who sent
’em.”</p>

<p>“He undoubtedly enticed us here for the purpose of
robbery,” said Senator Banning; “and the sooner we
land him in jail the better.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll let me explain——” began Farrington,
whose bedraggled appearance was little calculated to
inspire confidence.</p>

<p>“We’ve already had too many explanations!”
declared Mrs. Banning. “In all my visits to jails and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
penitentiaries I’ve rarely seen a man with a worse face
than the prisoner’s. I shouldn’t be at all surprised if
he turned out to be a murderer.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish!” sniffed Miss Collingwood. “He looks
like somebody’s chauffeur who’s been joy-rolling in
the mud.”</p>

<p>The truth would never be believed. Farrington
resolved to lie boldly.</p>

<p>“I was on my way to Lenox and missed the road.
I entered these grounds merely to make inquiries and
get some gasoline. This man you call Gadsby assaulted
me and dragged me in here; and, as I have nothing to
do with any of you or your troubles, I protest against
being detained longer.”</p>

<p>Gadsby’s derisive laugh expressed the general incredulity.</p>

<p>“You didn’t say anything to me about gasoline!
You were prowling round the house, and when I
nabbed you you tried to bolt. I guess we’ll just hold on
to you until we find out who sent all those fake telegrams.”</p>

<p>“We’ll hold on to him until we find out who’s kidnapped
Arabella!” declared Mrs. Banning.</p>

<p>“That’s a happy suggestion, Fanny,” affirmed the
Senator, for the first time relaxing his severity toward
his wife.</p>

<p>“What’s this outlaw’s name?” demanded Miss
Collingwood in lugubrious tones.</p>

<p>Clever criminals never disclosed their identity.
Farrington had no intention of telling his name.
He glowered at them as he involuntarily lifted his
hand to his mud-spattered face. Senator Banning
jumped back, stepping heavily on Coningsby’s feet.
Coningsby’s howl of pain caused Zaliska to laugh with
delight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“If you hold me here you’ll pay dearly for it,”
said Farrington fiercely.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear; the little boy’s going to cry!” mocked
the dancer. “I think he’d be nice if he had his face
washed. By-the-way, who’s giving this party anyhow?
I’m perfectly famished and just a little teeny-teeny
bite of food would go far toward saving your little
Zaliska’s life.”</p>

<p>“That’s another queer thing about all this!” exclaimed
the Senator. “Some one has opened up the house
and stocked it with provisions. The caretaker got a
telegram purporting to be from me telling him I’d
be down with a house party. However, the servants
are not here. The scoundrel who arranged all this
overlooked that.”</p>

<p>This for some occult reason drew attention back to
Farrington, and Gadsby shook him severely, presumably
in the hope of jarring loose some information.
Farrington resented being shaken. He stood glumly
watching them and awaiting his fate.</p>

<p>“It looks as though you’d all have to spend the
night here,” remarked the Senator. “There are no
trains out of Corydon until ten o’clock tomorrow.
By morning we ought to be able to fix the responsibility
for this dastardly outrage. In the meantime this
criminal shall be locked up!”</p>

<p>“Shudders, and clank, clank, as the prisoner goes
to his doom,” mocked Zaliska.</p>

<p>“The sooner he’s out of my sight the better,” Mrs.
Banning agreed heartily. “If he’s hidden my poor
dear Arabella away somewhere he’ll pay the severest
penalty of the law for it. I warn him of that.”</p>

<p>“In some states they hang kidnappers,” Miss Collingwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
recalled, as though the thought of hanging gave
her pleasure.</p>

<p>“We’ll put the prisoner in one of the servants’ rooms
on the third floor,” said the Senator; “and in the morning
we’ll drive him to Pittsfield and turn him over to
the authorities. Bring him along, Gadsby.”</p>

<p>Gadsby dragged Farrington upstairs and to the back
of the house, with rather more force than was necessary.
Banning led the way, bearing a poker he had snatched
up from the fireplace. Pushing him roughly into the
butler’s room, Gadsby told Farrington to hold up his
hands.</p>

<p>“We’ll just have a look at your pockets, young man.
No foolishness now!”</p>

<p>This was the last straw. Farrington fought. For
the first time in his life he struck a fellow man, and
enjoyed the sensation. He was angry, and the instant
Gadsby thrust a hand into his coat pocket he landed
on the detective’s nose with all the power he could
put into the blow.</p>

<p>Banning dropped the poker and ran out, slamming
the door after him. Two more sharp punches in the
detective’s face caused him to jump for a corner and
draw his gun. As he swung round, Farrington grabbed
the poker and dealt the officer’s wrist a sharp thwack
that knocked the pistol to the floor with a bang. In a
second the gun was in Farrington’s hand and he backed
to the door and jerked it open.</p>

<p>“Come in here, Senator!” he said as Banning’s
white face appeared. “Don’t yell or attempt to make
a row. I want you to put the key of that door on the
inside. If you don’t I’m going to shoot your friend
here. I don’t know who or what he is, but if you
don’t obey orders I’m going to kill him. And if you’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
not pretty lively with that key I’m going to shoot you
too. Shooting is one of the best things I do—careful
there, Mr. Gadsby! If you try to rush me you’re
a dead man!”</p>

<p>To demonstrate his prowess he played on both of
them with the automatic. Gadsby stood blinking,
apparently uncertain what to do. The key in Banning’s
hand beat a lively rat-tat in the lock as the frightened
statesman shifted it to the inside. Farrington was
enjoying himself; it was a sweeter pleasure than he
had ever before tasted to find that he could point
pistols and intimidate senators and detectives.</p>

<p>“That will do; thanks! Now Mr. Gadsby, or whatever
your name is, I must trouble you to remove yourself.
In other words, get out of here—quick! There’s
a bed in this room and I’m going to make myself comfortable
until morning. If you or any of you make
any effort to annoy me during the night I’ll shoot you,
without the slightest compunction. And when you
go downstairs you may save your faces by telling your
friends that you’ve locked me up and searched me, and
given me the third degree—and anything you please;
but don’t you dare come back! Just a moment more,
please! You’d better give yourself first aid for nosebleed
before you go down, Mr. Gadsby; but not here.
The sight of blood is displeasing to me. That is all
now. Good night, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>He turned the key, heard them conferring in low
tones for a few minutes, and then they retreated down
the hall. Zaliska had begun to thump the piano.
Her voice rose stridently to the popular air: Any
Time’s A Good Time When Hearts are Light and Merry.</p>

<p>Farrington sat on the bed and consoled himself with
a cigarette. As a fiction writer he had given much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
study to human motives; but just why the delectable
Arabella had mixed him up in this fashion with the
company below was beyond him. Perversity was all
he could see in it. He recalled now that she herself
had chosen all the names for her list, with the exception
of Banning and Gadsby; and, now that he thought of
it, she had more or less directly suggested them.</p>

<p>To be sure he had suggested the Senator; but only in a
whimsical spirit, as he might have named any other
person whose name was familiar in contemporaneous
history. Arabella had accepted it, he remembered,
with alacrity. He had read in the newspapers about
the Bannings’ marital difficulties, and he recalled that
Coningsby, a millionaire in one of the Western mining
states, had been implicated with Banning in a big irrigation
scandal.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Mrs. Banning had been outraged
by her husband’s efforts to marry Arabella to the
wheezing son of the magnate. In adding to the dramatis
personæ Zaliska, whose name had glittered on Broadway
in the biggest sign that thoroughfare had ever seen,
Arabella had contributed another element to the situation
which caused Farrington to grin broadly.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was only nine-thirty,
though it seemed that eternity had rolled by since his
first encounter with Gadsby. He had taken a pistol
away from a detective of reputation and pointed it at a
United States Senator; and he was no longer the Farrington
of yesterday, but a very different being, willing
that literature should go hang so long as he followed this
life of jaunty adventure.</p>

<p>After a brief rest he opened the door cautiously, crept
down the back stairs to the second floor, and, venturing
as close to the main stairway as he dared, heard lively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
talk in the hall below. Gadsby, it seemed, was for
leaving the house to bring help and the proposal was
not meeting with favor.</p>

<p>“I refuse to be left here without police protection,”
Mrs. Banning was saying with determination. “We
may all be murdered by that ruffian.”</p>

<p>“He’s undoubtedly a dangerous crook,” said the
officer; “but he’s safe for the night. And in the morning
we will take him to jail and find means of identifying
him.”</p>

<p>“Then for the love of Mike,” chirruped Zaliska from
the piano, “let’s have something to eat!”</p>

<p>Farrington chuckled. Gadsby and Banning had not
told the truth about their efforts to lock him up.
They were both cowards, he reflected; and they had no
immediate intention, at least, of returning to molest
him. In a room where Banning’s suitcase was spread
open he acquired an electric lamp, which he thrust
into his pocket. Sounds of merry activity from the
kitchen indicated that Zaliska had begun her raid on
the jam pots, assisted evidently by all the company.</p>

<p>One thought was uppermost in his mind—he must
leave the house as quickly as possible and begin the
search for Arabella. He wanted to look into her eyes
again; he wanted to hear her laughter as he told of the
result of her plotting. There was more to the plan
she had outlined at the tea house than had appeared,
and he meant to fathom the mystery; but
he wanted to see her for her own sake. His pulses
tingled as he thought of her—the incomparable girl
with the golden-brown eyes and the heart of laughter!</p>

<p>He cautiously raised a window in one of the sleeping
rooms and began flashing his lamp to determine his
position. He was at the rear of the house and the rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
purred softly on the flat roof of a one-story extension of
the kitchen, fifteen feet below. The sooner he risked
breaking his neck and began the pursuit of Arabella
the better; so he threw out his rubber coat and let
himself out on the sill.</p>

<p>He dropped and gained the roof in safety. Below,
on one side, were the lights of the dining room, and
through the open windows he saw his late companions
gathered about the table. The popping of a cork
evoked cheers, which he attributed to Zaliska and
Coningsby. He noted the Bishop and Miss Collingwood
in earnest conversation at one end of the room,
and caught a glimpse of Banning staggering in from
the pantry bearing a stack of plates, while his wife
distributed napkins. They were rallying nobly to
the demands upon their unwilling hospitality.</p>

<p>He crawled to the farther side of the roof, swung
over and let go, and the moment he touched the earth
was off with all speed for the road. It was good to be
free again, and he ran as he had not run since his
school-days, stumbling and falling over unseen obstacles
in his haste. In a sunken garden he tumbled
over a stone bench with a force that knocked the wind
out of him; but he rubbed his bruised legs and resumed
his flight.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard some one running over the gravel
path that paralleled the driveway. He stopped to
listen, caught the glimmer of a light—the merest faint
spark, as of some one flashing an electric lamp—and
then heard sounds of rapid retreat toward the road.</p>

<p>Resolving to learn which member of the party was
leaving, he changed his course and, by keeping the
lights of the house at his back, quickly gained the
stone fence at the roadside.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>When he had climbed halfway over he heard some
one stirring outside the wall between him and the gate;
then a motor started with a whir and an electric headlight
was flashed on blindingly. As the machine pushed
its way through the tangle of wet weeds into the open
road he clambered over, snapped his lamp at the driver,
and cried out in astonishment as the light struck
Arabella full in the face.</p>

<p>She ducked her head quickly, swung her car into
the middle of the road, and stopped.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“Wait just a minute! I want to speak to you; I
have ten thousand things to say to you!” he shouted
above the steady vibrations of the racing motor.</p>

<p>She leaned out, flashed her lamp on him, and laughed
tauntingly. She was buttoned up tightly in a leather
coat, but wore no hat; and her hair had tumbled loose
and hung wet about her face. Her eyes danced with
merriment.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s too soon!” she said, putting up her hand
to shield her eyes from his lamp. “Not a word to
say tonight; but tomorrow—at four o’clock—we
shall meet and talk it over. You have done beautifully—superbly!”
she continued. “I was looking
through the window when they dragged you off upstairs.
And I heard every word everybody said!
Isn’t it perfectly glorious?—particularly Zaliska! What
an awful mistake it would have been if we’d left her
out! Back, sir! I’m on my way!”</p>

<p>Before he could speak, her car shot forward. He
ran to his machine and flung himself into it; but Arabella
was driving like a king’s messenger. Her car,
a low-hung gray roadster, moved with incredible
speed. The rear light rose until it became a dim red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
star on the crest of a steep hill, and a second later it
blinked him good-by as it dipped down on the farther
side.</p>

<p>He gained the hilltop and let the machine run its
maddest. When he reached the bottom he was sure
he was gaining on the flying car, but suddenly the
guiding light vanished. He checked his speed to
study the trail more carefully, found that he had lost it,
turned back to a crossroad where Arabella had plunged
more deeply into the hills, and was off again.</p>

<p>The road was a strange one and hideously soggy.
The tail light of Arabella’s car brightened and faded
with the varying fortunes of the two machines; but he
made no appreciable gain. She was leading him into
an utterly strange neighborhood, and after half a dozen
turns he was lost.</p>

<p>Then his car landed suddenly on a sound piece of
road and he stepped on the accelerator. The rain had
ceased and patches of stars began to blink through the
broken clouds, but as his hopes rose the light he was
following disappeared; and a moment later he was
clamping on the brakes.</p>

<p>The road had landed him at the edge of a watery
waste, a fact of which he became aware only after
he had tumbled out of his machine and walked off a
dock. Some one yelled to him from a house at the
water’s edge and threatened to shoot if he didn’t make
himself scarce. And it was not Arabella’s voice!</p>

<p>He slipped and fell on the wet planks, and his incidental
remarks pertaining to this catastrophe were
translated into a hostile declaration by the owner of the
voice. A gun went off with a roar and Farrington
sprinted for his machine.</p>

<p>“If you’ve finished your target practice,” he called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
from the car with an effort at irony, “maybe you’ll tell
what this place is!”</p>

<p>The reply staggered him:</p>

<p>“This pond’s on Mr. Banning’s place. It’s private
grounds and ye can’t get through here. What ye doin’
down here anyhow?”</p>

<p>Farrington knew what he was doing. He was looking
for Arabella, who had apparently vanished into thin
air; but the tone of the man did not encourage confidences.
He was defeated and chagrined, to say
nothing of being chilled to the bone.</p>

<p>“You orto turned off a mile back there; this is a
private road,” the man volunteered grudgingly, “and
the gate ain’t going to be opened no more tonight.”</p>

<p>Farrington got his machine round with difficulty
and started slowly back. His reflections were not
pleasant ones. Arabella had been having sport with
him. She had led him in a semicircle to a remote
corner of her father’s estate, merely, it seemed, that he
might walk into a pond or be shot by the guardian of
the marine front of the property.</p>

<p>He had not thought Arabella capable of such malevolence;
it was not like the brown-eyed girl who had
fed him tea and sandwiches two days before to lure him
into such a trap. In his bewildered and depressed state
of mind he again doubted Arabella.</p>

<p>He reached home at one o’clock and took counsel
of his pipe until three, brooding over his adventure.</p>

<p>Hope returned with the morning. In the bright
sunlight he was ashamed of himself for doubting Arabella;
and yet he groped in the dark for an explanation
of her conduct. His reasoning powers failed to find an
explanation of that last trick of hers in leading him over
the worst roads in Christendom, merely to drop him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
into a lake in her father’s back yard. She might have
got rid of him easier than that!</p>

<p>The day’s events began early. As he stood in the
doorway of his garage, waiting for the chauffeur to
extract his runabout from its shell of mud, he saw
Gadsby and two strange men flit by in a big limousine.
As soon as his car was ready he jumped in and set off,
with no purpose but to keep in motion. He, the Farrington
of cloistral habits, had tasted adventure; and
it was possible that by ranging the county he might
catch a glimpse of the bewildering Arabella, who had
so disturbed the even order of his life.</p>

<p>He drove to Corydon, glanced into all the shops, and
stopped at the post office on an imaginary errand.
He bought a book of stamps and as he turned away
from the window ran into the nautical Miss Collingwood.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon!” he mumbled, and was hurrying on
when she took a step toward him.</p>

<p>“You needn’t lie to me, young man; you were in that
row at Banning’s last night, and I want to know what
you know about Arabella!”</p>

<p>This lady, who sailed a schooner for recreation, was
less formidable by daylight. It occurred to him that
she might impart information if handled cautiously.
They had the office to themselves and she drew him into
a corner of the room and assumed an air of mystery.</p>

<p>“That fool detective is at the telegraph office wiring
all the police in creation to look out for Arabella.
You’d better not let him see you. Gadsby is a brave
man by daylight!”</p>

<p>“If Arabella didn’t spend last night at her father’s
house I know nothing about her,” said Farrington
eagerly. “I have reason to assume that she did.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>She eyed him with frank distrust.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to bluff me! You’re mixed up in this
row some way; and if you’re not careful you’ll spend the
rest of your life in a large, uncomfortable penitentiary.
If that man at the telegraph office wasn’t such a fool——”</p>

<p>“You’re not in earnest when you say Miss Banning
wasn’t at home last night!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Decidedly I am! Do you suppose we’d all be
chasing over the country this morning looking for my
niece and offering rewards if we knew where she is?
I live on a schooner to keep away from trouble, and
this is what that girl has got me into! What’s your
name anyhow?”</p>

<p>He quickly decided against telling his name. At
that moment Gadsby’s burly frame became visible
across Main Street, and Farrington shot out a side door
and sprinted up an alley at his best speed. He struck
the railroad track at a point beyond the station where
it curved through the hills, and followed it for a mile
before stopping to breathe.</p>

<p>As he approached a highway he heard a motor
and flung himself down in the grass at the side of the
track. The driver of the car checked its speed and one
of his companions stood up and surveyed the long
stretch of track. The blue glint of gun barrels caught
Farrington’s eye.</p>

<p>There were three men in the machine and he guiltily
surmised that they were deputy sheriffs or constables
looking for him. He stuck his nose into the ground
and did not lift his head again until the sounds of the
motor faded away in the distance. Probably no roads
were safe, and even in following the railroad he might
walk into an ambush.</p>

<p>He abandoned the ties for flight over a wooded hill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
It was hard going and the underbrush slapped him
savagely in the face. A higher hill tempted him and a
still higher one, and he came presently to the top of a
young mountain. He sat for a time on a fallen tree
and considered matters. In his perturbed state of
mind it seemed to him that the faint clouds of dust he
saw rising in the roads below were all evidences of
pursuit. He picked out familiar landmarks and judged
that his flight over the hills had brought him within
four miles of his home.</p>

<p>Thoughts of home, and a tub, and clean clothes,
pleased him, and he resolutely began the descent. The
only way he could free himself from suspicion was by
finding Arabella. And how could he find Arabella
when he was likely at any moment to be run down by
a country constable with a shotgun? And as for
meeting Arabella at four o’clock, he realized now that he
had stupidly allowed the girl to slip away from him without
designating a meeting place.</p>

<p>So far as he knew, he was the only person who had seen
Arabella since her escape from Miss Collingwood’s
schooner. It might be well for him to volunteer to the
Bannings such information as he had; but the more he
thought of this the less it appealed to him. It would be
difficult to give a plausible account of his meeting with
Arabella at the tea house; and, moreover, he shrank
from a betrayal of the light-hearted follower of the silver
trumpet. As a gentleman he could give no version
of the affair that would not place all the blame on
himself; and this involved serious risks.</p>

<p>He approached his house from the rear, keeping as
far as possible from the road, lingered at the barn,
dodged from it to the garage, and crept furtively into
his study by a side door as the clock struck two.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>He had seen none of his employees on the farm and
the house was ominously still. He rang the bell and
in a moment the scared face of Beeching was thrust in.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon; are you home, sir?” asked the servant
with a frightened gulp.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m home!” said Farrington with all the
dignity his scratched face and torn clothes would
permit.</p>

<p>“I missed you, sir,” said the man gravely. “I
thought maybe you was off looking for Arabella.”</p>

<p>The book Farrington had been nervously fingering
fell with a bang.</p>

<p>“What—what the devil do you know about Arabella?”</p>

<p>“She’s lost, sir. The kennel master and the chauffeur
is off looking for her. It’s a most singular case.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Farrington assented; “most remarkable.
Have there been any—er—have any people been looking
here for—for her?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, the sheriff stopped a while ago to ask
whether we’d seen such a girl; and there was a constable
on horseback, and citizens in machines. Her father has
offered a reward of ten thousand dollars. And there’s
a man missing, they say, sir, a dangerous character they
caught on the Banning place last night. There’s a
thousand on him; it’s a kidnapping matter, sir.”</p>

<p>Farrington’s throat troubled him and he swallowed
hard.</p>

<p>“It’s a shameful case,” he remarked weakly. “I
hope they’ll kill the rascal when they catch him.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, sir,” said Beeching. “You seem quite
worn out, sir. Shall I serve something?”</p>

<p>“You may bring the Scotch—quick—and don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
bother about the water. And, Beeching, if anyone
calls I’m out!”</p>

<p>By the time he had changed his clothes and eaten
a belated luncheon it was three o’clock. From time
to time mad honking on the highway announced the
continuance of the search for Arabella. He had screwed
his courage to the point of telephoning Senator Banning
that Arabella had been seen near her father’s place
on the previous night. His spirits sank when the
Corydon exchange announced that the Banning phone
was out of order. The chauffeur, seeing Farrington’s
roadster on Main Street, telephoned from Corydon to
know what disposition should be made of it, and Farrington
ordered him to bring it home.</p>

<p>He regained his self-respect as he smoked a cigar.
He had met the issues of the night and day bravely; and
if further adventures lay before him he felt confident that
he would acquit himself well. And, in spite of the
tricks she had played on him, Arabella danced brightly
in his thoughts. He must find Arabella!</p>

<p>He thrust the revolver he had captured from Gadsby
into his pocket and drove resolutely toward the Bannings’.</p>

<p>A dozen machines blocked the entrance, indicating
a considerable gathering, and he steeled himself for an
interview that could hardly fail to prove a stormy one.
The door stood open and a company of twenty people
were crowded about a table. So great was their absorption
that Farrington joined the outer circle without
attracting attention.</p>

<p>“Mister Sheriff,” Senator Banning was saying, “we
shall make no progress in this affair until the man who
escaped from custody here last night has been apprehended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
You must impress a hundred—a thousand
deputies into service if necessary, and begin a systematic
search of every house, every hillside in Western Massachusetts.
I suggest that you throw a line from
here——”</p>

<p>They were craning their necks to follow his finger
across the map spread out on the table, when Miss
Collingwood’s voice was heard:</p>

<p>“I tell you again I saw that man in the post office
this morning, and the clerk told me he is Laurance
Farrington, the fool who writes such preposterous
novels.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said the sheriff irritably, “you’ve said
that before; but it’s impossible! I know Mr. Farrington
and he wouldn’t harm a flea. And the folks at his
house told me an hour ago that he was away looking
for the lost girl.”</p>

<p>“Only a bluff!” squeaked Coningsby. “He looked
to me like a bad man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t think he looked so rotten,” said Zaliska;
“but if he’s Farrington I must say his books bore me
to death!”</p>

<p>“Please remember this isn’t a literary club!”
shouted Senator Banning. “What do we care about his
books if he’s a kidnapper! What we’re trying to do is to
plan a thorough search of Berkshire County—of the
whole United States, if necessary.”</p>

<p>“So far as I’m concerned——” began Farrington in
a loud voice; but as twenty other voices were raised at
the same moment no one paid the slightest attention
to him. Their indifference enraged him and he pushed
his way roughly to the table and confronted Banning.
“While you’ve wasted your time looking for me I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
been—— Stand back! Don’t come a step nearer until
I’ve finished or I’ll kill you!”</p>

<p>It was Gadsby who had caused the interruption, but
the whole room was now in an uproar. With every one
talking at once Coningsby’s high voice alone rose above
the tempest. He wished he was armed; he would do
terrible things!</p>

<p>“Let the man tell his story,” pleaded Mrs. Banning
between sobs.</p>

<p>“I’ve spent the night and day looking for Arabella!”
Farrington cried. “I have no other interest—no other
aim in life but to find Arabella. All I can tell you is
that I saw her at the Sorona Tea House Tuesday afternoon,
and that last night she was on these grounds;
in fact, she saw you all gathered here and heard everything
that was said in this room.”</p>

<p>“Young man, you know too little or too much,” said
Banning. “Gadsby, do your duty!”</p>

<p>The detective took a step forward, looked into the
barrel of his own automatic, and paused, waving his
hand to the sheriff and his deputies to guard the doors
and windows.</p>

<p>“How do you know she was at the tea house?” asked
Mrs. Banning. “It seems to me that’s the first question.”</p>

<p>“I met her there,” Farrington blurted. “I met her
there by appointment!”</p>

<p>“Then you admit, you villain,” began Banning,
choking with rage, “that you lured my daughter, an
innocent child, to a lonely tea house; that you saw her
last night; and that now—now!—you know nothing of
her whereabouts! This, sir, is——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s really not so bad!” came in cheery tones
from above. “It was I who lured Mr. Farrington to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
tea house, and I did it because I knew he was a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Farrington had seen her first—the much-sought
Arabella—stealing down the stairway to the landing,
where she paused and leaned over the railing, much at
ease, to look at them.</p>

<p>Her name was spoken in gasps, in whispers, and was
thundered aloud only by Miss Collingwood.</p>

<p>“This was my idea,” said Arabella quietly as they
all turned toward her. “I’ve been hiding in the old
cottage by the pond, right here on father’s place—with
John and Mary, who’ve known me since I was a baby.
This is my house party—a scheme to get you all together.
I thought that maybe, if papa and mama really
thought I was lost, and if papa and Mr. Coningsby
and Mademoiselle Zaliska all met under the same roof,
they might understand one another better—and me.</p>

<p>“I telegraphed for Mr. Gadsby,” she laughed, “just
to be sure the rest of you were kept in order! And I sent
for Bishop Giddings because he’s an old friend, and I
thought he might help to straighten things out.”</p>

<p>She choked and the tears brightened her eyes as she
stood gazing down at them.</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry about me, Arabella,” said
Coningsby; “for Zaliska and I were married by the
Bishop at Corydon this morning.”</p>

<p>This seemed to interest no one in particular, though
Miss Collingwood sniffed contemptuously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Banning had started toward Arabella, and at
the same moment Senator Banning reached the stairway.
Arabella tripped down three steps, then paused
on tip-toe, with her hands outstretched, half-inviting,
half-repelling them. She was dressed as at the tea
house, but her youthfulness was lost for the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
in a grave wistfulness that touched Farrington deeply.</p>

<p>“You can’t have me,” she cried to her father and
mother, “unless we’re all going to be happy together
again!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Half an hour later Senator Banning and his wife,
and Arabella, wreathed in smiles, emerged from the
library and found the sheriff and his deputies gone; but
the members of the original house party still lingered.</p>

<p>“Before I leave,” said Gadsby, “I’d like to know
just how Mr. Farrington got into the game. He refuses
to tell how he came to see you at the tea house. I think
we ought to know that.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Arabella, clapping her hands, “that’s
another part of the story. If Mr. Farrington doesn’t
mind——”</p>

<p>“Now that you’re found I don’t care what you tell,”
Farrington declared.</p>

<p>“You may regret that,” said Arabella, coloring
deeply. “I sat by Mr. Baker, of <i>The Quill</i>, at a dinner
a little while ago, and we were talking about your
books. And he said—he said your greatest weakness
as a novelist was due to your never having—well”—she
paused and drew closer under the protecting arm of
her father—“you had never yourself been, as the saying
is—in love—and he thought—— Well, this is shameful—but
he and I—just as a joke—thought we d try to attract
your attention by printing that plot advertisement.
He said you were working too hard and seemed
worried, and might bite; and then I thought it would
be good fun to throw you into the lion’s den here to
stir things up, as you did. And I had my car on the
road last night ready to skip if things got too warm. Of
course I couldn’t let you catch me; it would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
spoiled all the fun! And it was I who shot off that
gun last night to scare you—when old John was scolding
you away from the place. But it was nasty of me,
and not fair; and now, when everything else is all fixed
and I’m so happy, I’m ashamed to look you in the face,
knowing what a lot of trouble I’ve given you. And
you’ll always hate me——”</p>

<p>“I shall always love you,” said Farrington, stepping
forward boldly and taking her hands. “You’ve made
me live for once in my life—you’ve made me almost
human,” he laughed. “And you’ve made me a braver
man than I know how to be! You pulled down the
silver trumpet out of heaven and gave it to me, and
made me rich beyond words; and without you I should
be sure to lose it again!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE THIRD MAN</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Webster G. Burgess asked ten of his cronies to
dine with him at the University Club on a night in
January they assumed that the president of the White
River National had been indulging in another adventure
which he wished to tell them about.</p>

<p>In spite of their constant predictions that if he didn’t
stop hiding crooks in his house and playing tricks on
the Police Department he would ultimately find himself
in jail, Mr. Burgess continued to find amusement in
frequent dallyings with gentlemen of the underworld.
In a town of approximately three hundred thousand
people a banker is expected to go to church on Sundays
and otherwise conduct himself as a decent, orderly,
and law-abiding citizen, but the president of the White
River National did not see things in that light. As a
member of the Board of Directors of the Released
Prisoners’ Aid Society he was always ready with the
excuse that his heart was deeply moved by the misfortunes
of those who keep to the dark side of the street,
and that sincere philanthropy covered all his sins in their
behalf.</p>

<p>When his friends met at the club and found Governor
Eastman one of the dinner party, they resented the
presence of that dignitary as likely to impose restraints
upon Burgess, who, for all his jauntiness, was not wholly
without discretion. But the governor was a good fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
as they all knew, and a story-teller of wide reputation.
Moreover, he was taking his job seriously, and, being
practical men, they liked this about him. It was said
that no governor since Civil War times had spent so
many hours at his desk or had shown the same zeal
and capacity for gathering information at first hand
touching all departments of the State government.
Eastman, as the country knows, is an independent
character, and it was this quality, shown first as a prosecuting
attorney, that had attracted attention and landed
him in the seat of the Hoosier governors.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” remarked Kemp as they sat down,
“that these tablets are scattered around the table so
we can make notes of the clever things that will be
said here tonight. It’s a good idea and gives me a
chance to steal some of your stories, governor.”</p>

<p>A scratch pad with pencil attached had been placed at
each plate, and the diners spent several minutes in
chaffing Burgess as to the purpose of this unusual table
decoration.</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Goring, “that Web is going to ask us
to write limericks for a prize and that the governor
is here to judge the contest. Indoor winter sports don’t
appeal to me; I pass.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to write notes to the House Committee on
mine,” said Fanning; “the food in this club is not what
it used to be, and it’s about time somebody kicked.”</p>

<p>“As I’ve frequently told you,” remarked Burgess,
smiling upon them from the head of the table, “you
fellows have no imagination. You’d never guess what
those tablets are for, and maybe I’ll never tell you.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is so innocent as a piece of white paper,”
said the governor, eyeing his tablet. “We’d better be
careful not to jot down anything that might fly up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
and hit us afterward. For all we know, it may be a
scheme to get our signatures for Burgess to stick on
notes without relief from valuation or appraisement
laws. It’s about time for another Bohemian oats
swindle, and our friend Burgess may expect to work us
for the price of the dinner.”</p>

<p>“Web’s bound to go to jail some day,” remarked
Ramsay, the surgeon, “and he’d better do it while
you’re in office, governor. You may not know that
he’s hand in glove with all the criminals in the country:
he quit poker so he could give all his time to playing with
crooks.”</p>

<p>“The warden of the penitentiary has warned me
against him,” replied the governor easily. “Burgess has
a man at the gate to meet convicts as they emerge,
and all the really bad ones are sent down here for
Burgess to put up at this club.”</p>

<p>“I never did that but once,” Burgess protested, “and
that was only because my mother-in-law was visiting
me and I was afraid she wouldn’t stand for a burglar
as a fellow guest. My wife’s got used to ’em. But
the joke of putting that chap up here at the club isn’t
on me, but on Ramsay and Colton. They had luncheon
with him one day and thanked me afterward for introducing
them to so interesting a man. I told them he
was a manufacturer from St. Louis, and they swallowed
it whole. Pettit was the name, but he has a
string of aliases as long as this table, and there’s not
a rogues’ gallery in the country where he isn’t indexed.
You remember, Colton, he talked a good deal of his
travels, and he could do so honestly, as he’d cracked
safes all the way from Boston to Seattle.”</p>

<p>Ramsay and Colton protested that this could not be
so; that the man they had luncheon with was a shoe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
manufacturer and had talked of his business as only an
expert could.</p>

<p>The governor and Burgess exchanged glances, and
both laughed.</p>

<p>“He knew the shoe business all right enough,” said
Burgess, “for he learned it in the penitentiary and
proved so efficient that they made him foreman of the
shop!”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Kemp, “that you’ve got another
crook coming to take that vacant chair. You’d better
tell us about him so we won’t commit any social errors.”</p>

<p>At the governor’s right there was an empty place,
and Burgess remarked carelessly that they were shy a
man, but that he would turn up later.</p>

<p>“I’ve asked Tate, a banker at Lorinsburg, to join us
and he’ll be along after a while. Any of you know
Tate? One of our scouts recently persuaded him to
transfer his account to us, and as this is the first time
he’s been in town since the change I thought it only
decent to show him some attention. We’re both directors
in a company that’s trying to develop a tile factory
in his town, so you needn’t be afraid I’m going to put
anything over on you. Tate’s attending a meeting
tonight from which I am regrettably absent! He
promised to be here before we got down to the coffee.”</p>

<p>As the dinner progressed the governor was encouraged
to tell stories, and acceded good-naturedly by recounting
some amusing things that had happened in the
course of his official duties.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t all so funny,” he said gravely after
keeping them in a roar for half an hour. “In a State
as big as this a good many disagreeable things happen,
and people come to me every day with heart-breaking
stories. There’s nothing that causes me more anxiety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
than the appeals for pardon; if the pardoning power
were taken away from me, I’d be a much happier man.
The Board of Pardons winnows out the cases, but even
at that there’s enough to keep me uncomfortable.
It isn’t the pleasantest feeling in the world that as you go
to bed at night somebody may be suffering punishment
unjustly, and that it’s up to you to find it out.
When a woman comes in backed by a child or two and
cries all over your office about her husband who’s
doing time and tells you he wasn’t guilty, it doesn’t
cheer you much; not by a jugful! Wives, mothers,
and sisters: the wives shed more tears, the sisters put
up the best argument, but the mothers give you more
sleepless nights.”</p>

<p>“If it were up to me,” commented Burgess, “I’m
afraid I’d turn ’em all out!”</p>

<p>“You would,” chorused the table derisively, “and
when you’d emptied the penitentiaries you’d burn
’em down!”</p>

<p>“Of course there’s bound to be cases of flagrant
injustice,” suggested Kemp. “And the feelings of a
man who is locked up for a crime he never committed
must be horrible. We hear now and then of such cases
and it always shakes my faith in the law.”</p>

<p>“The law does the best it can,” replied the governor
a little defensively, “but, as you say, mistakes do occur.
The old saying that murder will out is no good; we can
all remember cases where the truth was never known.
Mistakes occur constantly, and it’s the fear of not
rectifying them that’s making a nervous wreck of me.
I have in my pocket now a blank pardon that I meant
to sign before I left my office, but I couldn’t quite bring
myself to the point. The Pardon Board has made the
recommendation, not on the grounds of injustice—more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
I’m afraid, out of sympathy than anything else—and
we have to be careful of our sympathies in these matters.
And here again there’s a wife to reckon with. She’s
been at my office nearly every day for a year, and she’s
gone to my wife repeatedly to enlist her support.
And it’s largely through Mrs. Eastman’s insistence that
I’ve spent many weeks studying the case. It’s a
murder: what appeared to be a heartless, cold-blooded
assassination. And some of you may recall it—the
Avery case, seven years ago, in Salem County.”</p>

<p>Half the men had never heard of it and the others
recalled it only vaguely.</p>

<p>“It was an interesting case,” Burgess remarked,
wishing to draw the governor out. “George Avery was
a man of some importance down there and stood high
in the community. He owned a quarry almost eleven
miles from Torrenceville and maintained a bungalow
on the quarry land where he used to entertain his
friends with quail hunting and perhaps now and then
a poker party. He killed a man named Reynolds who
was his guest. As I remember, there seemed to be
no great mystery about it, and Avery’s defense was a
mere disavowal and a brilliant flourish of character
witnesses.”</p>

<p>“For all anybody ever knew, it was a plain case, as
Burgess says,” the governor began. “Avery and
Reynolds were business acquaintances and Avery had
invited Reynolds down there to discuss the merging
of their quarry interests. Reynolds was found dead
a little way from the bungalow by some of the quarry
laborers. He had been beaten on the head, with a club
in the most barbarous fashion. Reynolds’s overcoat
was torn off and the buttons ripped from his waistcoat,
pointing to a fierce struggle before his assailant got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
him down and pounded the life out of him. The
purpose was clearly not robbery, as Reynolds had
a considerable sum of money on his person that was
left untouched. When the men who found the body
went to rouse Avery he collapsed when told that
Reynolds was dead. In fact, he lay in a stupor for a
week, and they could get nothing out of him. Tracks?
No; it was a cold December night and the ground was
frozen.</p>

<p>“Reynolds had meant to take a midnight train for
Chicago, and Avery had wired for special orders to
stop at the quarry station, to save Reynolds the trouble
of driving into Torrenceville. One might have supposed
that Avery would accompany his visitor to the
station, particularly as it was not a regular stop for
night trains and the way across the fields was a little
rough. I’ve personally been over all the ground.
There are many difficult and inexplicable things about
the case, the absence of motive being one of them.
The State asserted business jealousy and substantiated
it to a certain extent, and the fact that Avery had taken
the initiative in the matter of combining their quarry
interests and might have used undue pressure on
Reynolds to force him to the deal is to be considered.”</p>

<p>The governor lapsed into silence, seemingly lost in
reverie. With his right hand he was scribbling idly
on the tablet that lay by his plate. The others, having
settled themselves comfortably in their chairs, hoping to
hear more of the murder, were disappointed when he
ceased speaking. Burgess’s usual calm, assured air
deserted him. He seemed unwontedly restless, and
they saw him glance furtively at his watch.</p>

<p>“Please, governor, won’t you go on with the story?”
pleaded Colton. “You know that nothing that’s said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
at one of Web’s parties ever goes out of the room.”</p>

<p>“That,” laughed the governor, “is probably unfortunate,
as most of his stories ought to go to the grand
jury. But if I may talk here into the private ear of
you gentlemen I will go on a little further. I’ve got to
make up my mind in the next hour or two about this
case, and it may help me to reach a conclusion to
think aloud about it.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of us,” said Burgess encouragingly.
“We’ve been meeting here—about the same
crowd—once a month for five years, and nobody has
ever blabbed anything.”</p>

<p>“All right; we’ll go a bit further. Avery’s stubborn
silence was a contributing factor in his prompt conviction.
A college graduate, a high-strung, nervous
man, hard-working and tremendously ambitious; successful,
reasonably prosperous, happy in his marriage,
and with every reason for living straight: there you
have George Avery as I make him out to have been
when this calamity befell him. There was just one
lapse, one error, in his life, but that didn’t figure in the
case, and I won’t speak of it now. His conduct from
the moment of his arrest, a week following the murder,
and only after every other possible clue had been exhausted
by the local authorities, was that of a man
mutely resigned to his fate. I find from the records that
he remained at the bungalow in care of a physician,
utterly dazed, it seemed, by the thing he had done, until
a warrant was issued and he was put in jail. He’s been
a prisoner ever since, and his silence has been unbroken
to this day. His wife assures me that he never, not
even to her, said one word about the case more than to
declare his innocence. I’ve seen him at the penitentiary
on two occasions, but could get nothing out of him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
In fact, I exhausted any ingenuity I may have in
attempting to surprise him into some admission that
would give me ground for pardoning him, but without
learning anything that was not in the State’s case.
They’re using him as a bookkeeper, and he’s made
a fine record: a model convict. The long confinement
has told seriously on his health, which is the
burden of his wife’s plea for his release, but he
wouldn’t even discuss that.</p>

<p>“There was no one else at the bungalow on the night
of the murder,” the governor continued. “It was
Avery’s habit to get his meals at the house of the quarry
superintendent, about five hundred yards away, and
the superintendent’s wife cared for the bungalow, but
the men I’ve had at work couldn’t find anything in that
to hang a clue on. You see, gentlemen, after seven
years it’s not easy to work up a case, but two expert
detectives that I employed privately to make some
investigations along lines I suggested have been of great
assistance. Failing to catch the scent where the trial
started, I set them to work backward from a point
utterly remote from the scene. It was a guess, and
ordinarily it would have failed, but in this case it has
brought results that are all but convincing.”</p>

<p>The tablets and pencils that had been distributed
along the table had not been neglected. The guests,
without exception, had been drawing or scribbling;
Colton had amused himself by sketching the governor’s
profile. Burgess seemed not to be giving his undivided
attention to the governor’s review of the case. He
continued to fidget, and his eyes swept the table with
veiled amusement. Then he tapped a bell and a
waiter appeared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Pardon me a moment, governor, till the cigars are
passed again.”</p>

<p>In his round with the cigar tray the Jap, evidently
by prearrangement, collected the tablets and laid them
in front of Burgess.</p>

<p>“Changed your mind about the Limerick contest,
Web?” asked some one.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Burgess carelessly; “the tablets
have fulfilled their purpose. It was only a silly idea
of mine anyhow.” They noticed, however, that a
tablet was left at the still vacant place that awaited the
belated guest, and they wondered at this, surmising
that Burgess had planned the dinner carefully and that
the governor’s discussion of the Avery case was by
connivance with their host. With a quickening of
interest they drew their chairs closer to the table.</p>

<p>“The prosecuting attorney who represented the State
in the trial is now a judge of the Circuit Court,” the
governor resumed when the door closed upon the waiter.
“I have had many talks with him about this case. He
confesses that there are things about it that still
puzzle him. The evidence was purely circumstantial, as
I have already indicated; but circumstantial evidence,
as Thoreau once remarked, may be very convincing,
as when you find a trout in the milk! But when two
men have spent a day together in the house of one of
them, and the other is found dead in a lonely place not
far away, and suspicion attaches to no one but the
survivor—not even the tramp who usually figures in
such speculations—a jury of twelve farmers may be
pardoned for taking the State’s view of the matter.”</p>

<p>“The motive you spoke of, business jealousy, doesn’t
seem quite adequate unless it could be established that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
they had quarreled and that there was a clear showing
of enmity,” suggested Fullerton, the lawyer.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, and the man who prosecuted
Avery admits it,” the governor answered.</p>

<p>“There may have been a third man in the affair,”
suggested Ramsey, “and I suppose the cynical must
have suggested the usual woman in the case.”</p>

<p>“I dare say those possibilities were thrashed out at
the time,” the governor replied; “but the only woman
in this case is Avery’s wife, and she and Reynolds had
never met. I have found nothing to sustain any suspicion
that there was a woman in the case. Avery’s
ostensible purpose in asking Reynolds to visit him at
that out-of-the-way place was merely that they could
discuss the combination of their quarry interests
privately, and close to Avery’s plant. It seems that
Avery had undertaken the organization of a big company
to take over a number of quarries whose product
was similar, and that he wished to confer secretly with
Reynolds to secure his sanction to a selling agreement
before the others he wanted to get into the combination
heard of it. That, of course, is perfectly plausible; I
could make a good argument justifying that. Reynolds,
like many small capitalists in country towns,
had a number of irons in the fire and had done some
promoting on his own hook. All the financial genius
and all the financial crookedness aren’t confined to
Wall Street, though I forget that sometimes when I’m
on the stump! I’m disposed to think from what I’ve
learned of both of them that Avery wasn’t likely to
put anything over on Reynolds, who was no child in
business matters. And there was nothing to show
that Avery had got him down there for any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
purpose than to effect a merger of quarry interests for
their mutual benefit.”</p>

<p>“There probably were papers to substantiate that,”
suggested Fullerton; “correspondence and that sort
of thing.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; I have gone into that,” the governor
replied. “All the papers remain in the office of the
prosecuting attorney, and I have examined them carefully.
Now, if Avery had been able to throw suspicion
on some one else you’d think he’d have done so. And
if there had been a third person at the bungalow that
night you’d imagine that Avery would have said so;
it’s not in human nature for one man to take the blame
for another’s crime, and yet we do hear of such things,
and I have read novels and seen plays built upon that
idea. But here is Avery with fifteen years more to
serve, and, if he’s been bearing the burden and suffering
the penalty of another’s sin, I must say that he’s taking
it all in an amazing spirit of self-sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Fullerton, “Reynolds may have had
an enemy who followed him there and lay in wait for
him. Or Avery may have connived at the crime without
being really the assailant. That is conceivable.”</p>

<p>“We’ll change the subject for a moment,” said the
governor, “and return to our muttons later.”</p>

<p>He spoke in a low tone to Burgess, who looked at
his watch and answered audibly:</p>

<p>“We have half an hour more.”</p>

<p>The governor nodded and, with a whimsical smile,
began turning over the tablets.</p>

<p>“These pads were placed before you for a purpose
which I will now explain. I apologize for taking advantage
of you, but you will pardon me, I’m sure, when
I tell you my reason. I’ve dipped into psychology<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
lately with a view to learning something of the mind’s
eccentricities. We all do things constantly without
conscious effort, as you know; we perform acts automatically
without the slightest idea that we are doing
them. At meetings of our State boards I’ve noticed
that nobody ever uses the pads that are always provided
except to scribble on. Many people have that habit
of scribbling on anything that’s handy. Hotel keepers
knowing this, provide pads of paper ostensibly for
memoranda that guests may want to make while at the
telephone, but really to keep them from defacing the
wall. Left alone with pencil and paper, most of us will
scribble something or draw meaningless figures.</p>

<p>“Sometimes it’s indicative of a deliberate turn of
mind; again it’s sheer nervousness. After I had discussed
this with a well-known psychologist I began
watching myself and found that I made a succession
of figure eights looped together in a certain way—I’ve
been doing it here!</p>

<p>“And now,” he went on with a chuckle, “you gentlemen
have been indulging this same propensity as you
listened to me. I find on one pad the word Napoleon
written twenty times with a lot of flourishes; another
has traced a dozen profiles of a man with a bulbous nose:
it is the same gentleman, I find, who honored me by
drawing me with a triple chin—for which I thank him.
And here’s what looks like a dog kennel repeated down
the sheet. Still another has sketched the American flag
all over the page. If the patriotic gentleman who drew
the flag will make himself known, I should like to ask
him whether he’s conscious of having done that before?”</p>

<p>“I’m guilty, governor,” Fullerton responded. “I
believe it is a habit of mine. I’ve caught myself doing
it scores of times.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“I’m responsible for the man with the fat nose,”
confessed Colton; “I’ve been drawing him for years
without ever improving my draftsmanship.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” said the governor, glancing at the
door. “We won’t take time to speak of the others,
though you may be relieved to know that I haven’t got
any evidence against you. Burgess, please get these
works of art out of the room. We’ll go back to the
Avery case. In going over the papers I found that the
prosecuting attorney in his search of the bungalow the
morning after the murder found a number of pieces of
paper that bore an odd, irregular sort of sketch. I’m
going to pass one of them round, but please send it
back to me immediately.”</p>

<p>He produced a sheet of letter paper that bore traces
of hasty crumpling, but it had been smoothed out again,
and held it up. It bore the lithographed name of the
Avery Quarry Company. On it was drawn this device:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“Please note,” said the governor as the paper passed
from hand to hand, “that that same device is traced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
there five times, sometimes more irregularly than others,
but the general form is the same. Now, in the fireplace
of the bungalow living-room they found this and three
other sheets of the same stationery that bore this same
figure. It seems a fair assumption that some one sitting
at a table had amused himself by sketching these outlines
and then, when he had filled the sheet, tore it
off and threw it into the fireplace, wholly unconscious
of what he was doing. The prosecutor attached no
importance to these sheets, and it was only by chance
that they were stuck away in the file box with the other
documents in the case.”</p>

<p>“Then you suspect that there was a third man in the
bungalow that night?” Ramsay asked.</p>

<p>The governor nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“Yes; I have some little proof of it, quite a bit of
proof, in fact. I have even had the wastebasket of the
suspect examined for a considerable period. Knowing
Burgess’s interest in such matters, I have been using
him to get me certain information I very much wanted.
And our friend is a very successful person! I wanted to
see the man I have in mind and study him a little when
he was off-guard, and Burgess has arranged that for
me, though he had to go into the tile business to do it!
As you can readily see, I could hardly drag him to my
office, so this little party was gotten up to give me a
chance to look him over at leisure.”</p>

<p>“Tate!” exclaimed several of the men.</p>

<p>“You can see that this is a very delicate matter,”
said the governor slowly. “Burgess thought it better
not to have a smaller party, as Tate, whom I never saw,
might think it a frame-up. So you see we are using
you as stool-pigeons, so to speak. Burgess vouches for
you as men of discretion and tact; and it will be your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
business to keep Tate amused and his attention away
from me while I observe him a little.”</p>

<p>“And when I give the signal you’re to go into the
library and look at picture books,” Burgess added.</p>

<p>“That’s not fair!” said Fullerton. “We want to see
the end of it!”</p>

<p>“I’m so nervous,” said Colton, “I’m likely to scream
at any minute!”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it!” Burgess admonished. “The new
House Committee is very touchy about noise in the
private dining rooms, and besides I’ve got a lot of
scenery set for the rest of the evening, and I don’t want
you fellows to spoil it.”</p>

<p>“It begins to look,” remarked the governor, glancing
at his watch, “as though some of our scenery might
have got lost.”</p>

<p>“He’d hardly bolt,” Burgess replied; “he knows of
no reason why he should! I told the doorman to send
him right up. When he comes there will be no more
references to the Avery case: you all understand?”</p>

<p>They murmured their acquiescence, and a solemn
hush fell upon them as they turned involuntarily toward
the vacant chair.</p>

<p>“This will never do!” exclaimed the governor, who
seemed to be the one tranquil person in the room. “We
must be telling stories and giving an imitation of weary
business men having a jolly time. But I’m tired of
talking; some of the good story-tellers ought to be stirred
up.”</p>

<p>With a little prodding Fullerton took the lead, but
was able to win only grudging laughter. Colton was
trying his hand at diverting them when they were
startled by a knock. Burgess was at the door instantly
and flung it open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>“Ah, Tate! Come right in; the party hasn’t started
yet!”</p>

<p>The newcomer was a short, thickset man, clean
shaven, with coarse dark hair streaked with gray.
The hand he gave the men in succession as they
gathered about him for Burgess’s introduction was
broad and heavy. He offered it limply, with an air of
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Governor Eastman, Mr. Tate; that’s your seat by
the governor, Tate,” said Burgess. “We were just
listening to some old stories from some of these fellows,
so you haven’t missed anything. I hope they didn’t
need me at that tile meeting; I never attend night
meetings: they spoil my sleep, which my doctor says
I’ve got to have.”</p>

<p>“Night meetings,” said the governor, “always give
me a grouch the next morning. A party like this
doesn’t, of course!”</p>

<p>“Up in the country where I live we still stick to
lodge meetings as an excuse when we want a night off,”
Tate remarked.</p>

<p>They laughed more loudly than was necessary to put
him at ease. He refused Burgess’s offer of food and
drink and when some one started a political discussion
they conspired to draw him into it. He was County
Chairman of the party not then in power and complained
good-naturedly to the governor of the big
plurality Eastman had rolled up in the last election.
He talked slowly, with a kind of dogged emphasis, and
it was evident that politics was a subject to his taste.
His brown eyes, they were noting, were curiously
large and full, with a bilious tinge in the white. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
met a glance steadily, with, indeed, an almost disconcerting
directness.</p>

<p>Where the governor sat became, by imperceptible
degrees, the head of the table as he began seriously
and frankly discussing the points of difference between
the existing parties, accompanied by clean-cut characterizations
of the great leaders.</p>

<p>There was nothing to indicate that anything lay
behind his talk; to all appearances his auditors were
absorbed in what he was saying. Tate had accepted
a cigar, which he did not light but kept twisting slowly
in his thick fingers.</p>

<p>“We Democrats have had to change our minds about
a good many things,” the governor was saying. “Of
course we’re not going back to Jefferson” (he smiled
broadly and waited for them to praise his magnanimity
in approaching so near to an impious admission), “but the
world has spun around a good many times since Jefferson’s
day. What I think we Democrats do and do
splendidly is to keep close to the changing current of
public opinion; sometimes it seems likely to wash us
down, as in the free-silver days; but we give, probably
without always realizing it, a chance for the people to
express themselves on new questions, and if we’ve
stood for some foolish policies at times the country’s
the better for having passed on them. These great
contests clear the air like a storm, and we all go peacefully
about our business afterward.”</p>

<p>As he continued they were all covertly watching
Tate, who dropped his cigar and began playing
with the pencil before him, absently winding and unwinding
it upon the string that held it to the tablet.
They were feigning an absorption in the governor’s
recital which their quick, nervous glances at Tate’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
hand belied. Burgess had pushed back his chair to
face the governor more comfortably and was tying
knots in his napkin.</p>

<p>Now and then Tate nodded solemnly in affirmation
of something the governor said, but without lifting his
eyes from the pencil. His broad shoulders were bent
over the table, and the men about him were reflecting
that this was probably an attitude into which his heavy
body often relaxed when he was pondering deeply.</p>

<p>Wearying of the pencil—a trifle of the dance-card
variety—he dropped it and drew his own from his
waistcoat pocket. Then, after looking up to join in a
laugh at some indictment of Republicanism expressed
in droll terms by the governor, he drew the tablet
closer and, turning his head slightly to one side, drew a
straight line. Burgess frowned as several men changed
position the better to watch him. The silence deepened,
and the governor’s voice rose with a slight oratorical
ring. Through a half-open window floated the
click of billiard balls in the room below. The governor
having come down to the Wilson Administration,
went back to Cleveland, whom he praised as a great
leader and a great president. In normal circumstances
there would have been interruptions and questions and
an occasional jibe; and ordinarily the governor, who
was not noted for loquacity, would not have talked
twenty minutes at a stretch without giving an opportunity
to his companions to break in upon him. He
was talking, as they all knew, to give Tate time to draw
the odd device which it was his habit to sketch when
deeply engrossed.</p>

<p>The pencil continued to move over the paper; and
from time to time Tate turned the pad and scrutinized
his work critically. The men immediately about him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
watched his hand, wide-eyed, fascinated. There was
something uncanny and unreal in the situation: it
was like watching a wild animal approaching a trap and
wholly unmindful of its danger. The square box which
formed the base of the device was traced clearly; the
arcs which were its familiar embellishment were carefully
added. The governor, having exhausted Cleveland,
went back to Jackson, and Tate finished a second
drawing, absorbed in his work and rarely lifting his
eyes.</p>

<p>Seeing that Tate had tired of this pastime, the governor
brought his lecture to an end, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Great Scott, Burgess! Why haven’t you stopped
me! I’ve said enough here to ruin me with my party,
and you hadn’t the grace to shut me off.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad for one,” said Tate, pushing back the pad,
“that I got in in time to hear you; I’ve never known
before that any Democrat could be so broad-minded!”</p>

<p>“The governor loosens up a good deal between campaigns,”
said Burgess, rising. “And now, let’s go into
the library where the chairs are easier.”</p>

<p>The governor rose with the others, but remained
by his chair, talking to Tate, until the room cleared,
and then resumed his seat.</p>

<p>“This is perfectly comfortable; let’s stay here, Mr.
Tate. Burgess, close the door, will you.”</p>

<p>Tate hesitated, looked at his watch, and glanced at
Burgess, who sat down as though wishing to humor the
governor, and lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tate,” said the governor unhurriedly, “if I’m
not mistaken, you are George Avery’s brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>Tate turned quickly, and his eyes widened in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered in slow, even tones; “Avery
married my sister.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Mr. Tate, I have in my pocket a pardon all ready
to sign, giving Avery his liberty. His case has troubled
me a good deal; I don’t want to sign this pardon unless
I’m reasonably sure of Avery’s innocence. If you were
in my place, Mr. Tate, would you sign it?”</p>

<p>The color went out of the man’s face and his jaw fell;
but he recovered himself quickly.</p>

<p>“Of course, governor, it would be a relief to me, to
my sister, all of us, if you could see your way to pardoning
George. As you know, I’ve been doing what I
could to bring pressure to bear on the Board of Pardons:
everything that seemed proper. Of course,” he went on
ingratiatingly, “we’ve all felt the disgrace of the thing.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Tate,” the governor interrupted, “I have
reason to believe that there was a third man at Avery’s
bungalow the night Reynolds was killed. I’ve been
at some pains to satisfy myself of that. Did that ever
occur to you as a possibility?”</p>

<p>“I suspected that all along,” Tate answered, drawing
his handkerchief slowly across his face. “I never could
believe George Avery guilty; he wasn’t that kind of
man!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he was myself,” the governor replied.
“Now, Mr. Tate, on the night of the murder you were
not at home, nor on the next day when your sister
called you on the long-distance telephone. You were
in Louisville, were you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly; I was in Louisville.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, Mr. Tate, you were not in
Louisville! You were at Avery’s bungalow that night,
and you left the quarry station on a freight train that
was sidetracked on the quarry switch to allow the
Chicago train to pass. You rode to Davos, which
you reached at two o’clock in the morning. There you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
registered under a false name at the Gerber House, and
went home the next evening pretending to have been
at Louisville. You are a bachelor, and live in rooms
over your bank, and there was no one to keep tab on
your absences but your clerks, who naturally thought
nothing of your going to Louisville, where business
often takes you. You were there two days ago, I
believe. But that has nothing to do with this
matter. When you heard that Reynolds was dead and
Avery under suspicion you answered your sister’s
summons and hurried to Torrenceville.”</p>

<p>“I was in Louisville; I was in Louisville, I tell you!”
Tate uttered the words in convulsive gasps. He
brushed the perspiration from his forehead impatiently
and half rose.</p>

<p>“Please sit down, Mr. Tate. You had had trouble
a little while before that with Reynolds about some
stock in a creamery concern in your county that he
promoted. You thought he had tricked you, and very
possibly he had. The creamery business had resulted
in a bitter hostility between you: it had gone to such
an extent that he had refused to see you again to discuss
the matter. You brooded over that until you were not
quite sane where Reynolds was concerned: I’ll give
you the benefit of that. You asked your brother-in-law
to tell you when Reynolds was going to see him, and
he obligingly consented. We will assume that Avery,
a good fellow and anxious to aid you, made a meeting
possible. Reynolds wasn’t to know that you were to
be at the bungalow—he wouldn’t have gone if he had
known it—and Avery risked the success of his own
negotiations by introducing you into his house, out of
sheer good will and friendship. You sat at a table in the
bungalow living-room and discussed the matter. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
of these things only I have guessed at; the rest of it——”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie; it’s all a damned lie! This was a scheme
to get me here: you and Burgess have set this up on me!
I tell you I wasn’t at the quarry; I never saw Reynolds
there that night or any other time. My God, if I had
been there,—if Avery could have put it on me, would
he be doing time for it?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily, Mr. Tate. Let us go back a little.
It had been in your power once to do Avery a great
favor, a very great favor. That’s true, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Tate stared, clearly surprised, but his quivering lips
framed no answer.</p>

<p>“You had known him from boyhood, and shortly
after his marriage to your sister it had been in your
power to do him a great favor; you had helped him out
of a hole and saved the quarry for him. It cost me
considerable money to find that out, Mr. Tate, and not
a word of help have I had from Avery: be sure of that!
He had been guilty of something just a little irregular—in
fact, the forging of your name to a note—and you
had dealt generously with him, out of your old-time
friendship, we will say, or to spare your sister humiliation.”</p>

<p>“George was in a corner,” said Tate weakly but with
manifest relief at the turn of the talk. “He squared it
all long ago.”</p>

<p>“It’s natural, in fact, instinctive, for a man to protect
himself, to exhaust all the possibilities of defense when
the law lays it hand upon him. Avery did not do so,
and his meek submission counted heavily against him.
But let us consider that a little. You and Reynolds
left the bungalow together, probably after the interview
had added to your wrath against him, but you wished
to renew the talk out of Avery’s hearing and volunteered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
to guide Reynolds to the station where the
Chicago train was to stop for him. You didn’t go
back, Mr. Tate——”</p>

<p>“Good God, I tell you I wasn’t there! I can prove
that I was in Louisville; I tell you——”</p>

<p>“We’re coming back to your alibi in a moment,”
said the governor patiently. “We will assume—merely
assume for the moment—that you said you
would take the train with Reynolds and ride as far as
Ashton, where the Midland crosses and you would get
an early morning train home. Avery went to sleep at
the bungalow wholly ignorant of what had happened;
he was awakened in the morning with news that Reynolds
had been killed by blows on the head inflicted
near the big derrick where you and Reynolds—I am
assuming again—had stopped to argue your grievances.
Avery—shocked, dazed, not comprehending his danger
and lying there in the bungalow prostrated and half-crazed
by the horror of the thing—waited: waited for
the prompt help he expected from the only living person
who knew that he had not left the bungalow. He
knew you only as a kind, helpful friend, and I dare say
at first he never suspected you! It was the last thing
in the world he would have attributed to you, and the
possibility of it was slow to enter his anxious, perturbed
mind. He had every reason for sitting tight in those
first hideous hours, confident that the third man at that
bungalow gathering would come forward and establish
his innocence with a word. As is the way in such cases,
efforts were made to fix guilt upon others; but Avery,
your friend, the man you had saved once, in a fine
spirit of magnanimity, waited for you to say the word
that would clear him. But you never said that word,
Mr. Tate. You took advantage of his silence; a silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
due, we will say, to shock and horror at the catastrophe
and to his reluctance to believe you guilty of so monstrous
a crime or capable of allowing him, an innocent
man, to suffer the penalty for it.”</p>

<p>Tate’s big eyes were bent dully upon the governor.
He averted his gaze slowly and reached for a glass of
water, but his hand shook so that he could not lift it,
and he glared at it as though it were a hateful thing.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t there! Why——” he began with an
effort at bravado; but the words choked him and he sat
swinging his head from side to side and breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>The governor went on in the same low, even tone he
had used from the beginning:</p>

<p>“When Avery came to himself and you still were
silent, he doubtless saw that, having arranged for you
to meet Reynolds at the bungalow—Reynolds, who
had been avoiding you—he had put himself in the
position of an accessory before the fact and that
even if he told the truth about your being there he
would only be drawing you into the net without wholly
freeing himself. At best it was an ugly business, and
being an intelligent man he knew it. I gather that
you are a secretive man by nature; the people who know
you well in your own town say that of you. No one
knew that you had gone there and the burden of the
whole thing was upon Avery. And your tracks were
so completely hidden: you had been at such pains to
sneak down there to take advantage of the chance
Avery made for you to see Reynolds and have it out with
him about the creamery business, that suspicion never
attached to you. You knew Avery as a good fellow,
a little weak, perhaps, as you learned from that forgery
of your name ten years earlier; and it would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
his word against yours. I’ll say to you, Mr. Tate, that
I’ve lain awake at nights thinking about this case, and
I know of nothing more pitiful, my imagination can
conjure nothing more horrible, than the silent suffering
of George Avery as he waited for you to go to his rescue,
knowing that you alone could save him.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it!” Tate reiterated in
a hoarse whisper that died away with a queer guttural
sound in his throat.</p>

<p>“And now about your alibi, Mr. Tate; the alibi that
you were never even called on to establish,” the governor
reached for the tablet and held it before the man’s
eyes, which focused upon it slowly, uncomprehendingly.
“Now,” said the governor, “you can hardly deny that
you drew that sketch, for I saw you do it with my own
eyes. I’m going to ask you, Mr. Tate, whether this
drawing isn’t also your work?”</p>

<p>He drew out the sheet of paper he had shown the
others earlier in the evening and placed it beside the
tablet. Tate jumped to his feet, staring wild-eyed,
and a groan escaped him. The governor caught his
arm and pushed him back into his chair.</p>

<p>“You will see that that is Avery’s letter-head that
was used in the quarry office. As you talked there with
Reynolds that night you played with a pencil as you
did here a little while ago and without realizing it you
were creating evidence against yourself that was all I
needed to convince me absolutely of your guilt. I
have three other sheets of Avery’s paper bearing the
same figure that you drew that night at the quarry
office; and I have others collected in your own office
within a week! As you may be aware, the power of
habit is very strong. For years, no doubt, your subconsciousness
has carried that device, and in moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
of deep abstraction with wholly unrelated things your
hand has traced it. Even the irregularities in the outline
are identical, and the size and shading are precisely
the same. I ask you again, Mr. Tate, shall I sign the
pardon I brought here in my pocket and free George
Avery?”</p>

<p>The sweat dripped from Tate’s forehead and trickled
down his cheeks in little streams that shone in the light.
His collar had wilted at the fold, and he ran his finger
round his neck to loosen it. Once, twice, he lifted his
head defiantly, but, meeting the governor’s eyes fixed
upon him relentlessly, his gaze wavered. He thrust
his hand under his coat and drew out his pencil and
then, finding it in his fingers, flung it away, and his
shoulders drooped lower.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Burgess stood by the window with his back to them.
The governor spoke to him, and he nodded and left the
room. In a moment he returned with two men and
closed the door quickly.</p>

<p>“Hello, warden; sit down a moment, will you?”</p>

<p>The governor turned to a tall, slender man whose
intense pallor was heightened by the brightness of his
oddly staring blue eyes. He advanced slowly. His
manner was that of a blind man moving cautiously in
an unfamiliar room. The governor smiled reassuringly
into his white, impassive face.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to see you, Mr. Avery,” he said.
He rose and took Avery by the hand.</p>

<p>At the name Tate’s head went up with a jerk. His
chair creaked discordantly as he turned, looked up into
the masklike face behind him, and then the breath went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
out of him with a sharp, whistling sound as when a man
dies, and he lunged forward with his arms flung out
upon the table.</p>

<p>The governor’s grip tightened upon Avery’s hand;
there was something of awe in his tone when he spoke.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid, Avery,” he said. “My way
of doing this is a little hard, I know, but it seemed the
only way. I want you to tell me,” he went on slowly,
“whether Tate was at the bungalow the night Reynolds
was killed. He was there, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>Avery wavered, steadied himself with an effort, and
slowly shook his head. The governor repeated his
question in a tone so low that Burgess and the warden,
waiting at the window, barely heard. A third time he
asked the question. Avery’s mouth opened, but he only
wet his lips with a quick, nervous movement of the
tongue, and his eyes met the governor’s unseeingly.</p>

<p>The governor turned from him slowly, and his left
hand fell upon Tate’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“If you are not guilty, Tate, now is the time for you
to speak. I want you to say so before Avery; that’s
what I’ve brought him here for. I don’t want to make
a mistake. If you say you believe Avery to be guilty,
I will not sign his pardon.”</p>

<p>He waited, watching Tate’s hands as they opened and
shut weakly; they seemed, as they lay inert upon the
table, to be utterly dissociated from him, the hands of
an automaton whose mechanism worked imperfectly.
A sob, deep, hoarse, pitiful, shook his burly form.</p>

<p>The governor sat down, took a bundle of papers from
his pocket, slipped one from under the rubber band
which snapped back sharply into place. He drew out
a pen, tested the point carefully, then, steadying it
with his left hand, wrote his name.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Warden,” he said, waving the paper to dry the ink;
“thank you for your trouble. You will have to go home
alone. Avery is free.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>When Burgess appeared at the bank at ten o’clock
the next morning he found his friends of the night before
established in the directors’ room waiting for him.
They greeted him without their usual chaff, and he
merely nodded to all comprehendingly and seated
himself on the table.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to bother you, Web,” said Colton,
“but I guess we’d all feel better if we knew what happened
after we left you last night. I hope you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>Burgess frowned and shook his head.</p>

<p>“You ought to thank God you didn’t have to see the
rest of it! I’ve got a reservation on the Limited tonight:
going down to the big city in the hope of getting it out
of my mind.”</p>

<p>“Well, we know only what the papers printed this
morning,” said Ramsay; “a very brief paragraph
saying that Avery had been pardoned. The papers
don’t tell the story of his crime as they usually do, and
we noticed that they refrained from saying that the
pardon was signed at one of your dinner parties.”</p>

<p>“I fixed the newspapers at the governor’s request.
He didn’t want any row made about it, and neither did
I, for that matter. Avery is at my house. His wife
was there waiting for him when I took him home.”</p>

<p>“We rather expected that,” said Colton, “as we were
planted at the library windows when you left the club.
But about the other man: that’s what’s troubling us.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Um,” said Burgess, crossing his legs and clasping
his knees. “<i>That</i> was the particular hell of it.”</p>

<p>“Tate was guilty; we assume that of course,” suggested
Fullerton. “We all saw him signing his death
warrant right there at the table.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Burgess replied gravely, “and he virtually
admitted it; but if God lets me live I hope never to see
anything like that again!”</p>

<p>He jumped down and took a turn across the room.</p>

<p>“And now—— After that, Web?”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t take long to tell it. After the governor
signed the pardon I told the warden to take Avery
downstairs and get him a drink: the poor devil was all in.
And then Tate came to, blubbering like the vile coward
he is, and began pleading for mercy: on his knees,
mind you; on his <i>knees</i>! God! It was horrible—horrible
beyond anything I ever dreamed of—to see him
groveling there. I supposed, of course, the governor
would turn him over to the police. I was all primed for
that, and Tate expected it and bawled like a sick calf.
But what he said was—what the governor said was,
and he said it the way they say ‘dust to dust’ over a
grave—‘You poor fool, for such beasts as you the
commonwealth has no punishment that wouldn’t
lighten the load you’ve got to carry around with you
till you die!’ That’s all there was of it! That’s exactly
what he said, and can you beat it? I got a room for
Tate at the club, and told one of the Japs to put him to
bed.”</p>

<p>“But the governor had no right,” began Ramsay
eagerly; “he had no <i>right</i>——”</p>

<p>“The king can do no wrong! And, if you fellows
don’t mind, the incident is closed, and we’ll never speak
of it again.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WRONG NUMBER</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> called him Wrong Number in the bank because
he happened so often and was so annoying. His presence
in the White River National was painful to bookkeepers,
tellers and other practical persons connected
with this financial Gibraltar because, without having
any definite assignment, he was always busy. He was
carried on the rolls as a messenger, though he performed
none of the duties commonly associated with the vocation,
calling or job of a bank messenger. No one assumed
responsibility for Wrong Number, not even the
Cashier or the First Vice President, and such rights,
powers and immunities as he enjoyed were either self-conferred
or were derived from the President, Mr.
Webster G. Burgess.</p>

<p>Wrong Number’s true appellation as disclosed by
the payroll was Clarence E. Tibbotts, and the cynical
note-teller averred that the initial stood for Elmer. A
small, compact figure, fair hair, combed to onion-skin
smoothness, a pinkish face and baby blue eyes—there
was nothing in Wrong Number’s appearance to arouse
animosity in any but the stoniest heart. Wrong Number
was polite, he was unfailingly cheerful, and when
called upon to assist in one place or another he responded
with alacrity and no one had reason to complain
of his efficiency. He could produce a letter from
the files quicker than the regular archivist, or he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
play upon the adding machine as though it were an
instrument of ten strings. No one had ever taught him
anything; no one had the slightest intention of teaching
him anything, and yet by imperceptible degrees, he,
as a free lance, passed through a period of mild tolerance
into acceptance as a valued and useful member
of the staff. In the Liberty Loan rushes that well-nigh
swamped the department, Wrong Number knew
the answers to all the questions that were fired through
the wickets. Distracted ladies who had lost their receipts
for the first payment and timidly reported this
fact found Wrong Number patient and helpful. An
early fear in the cages that the president had put Wrong
Number into the bank as a spy upon the clerical force
was dispelled, when it became known that the young
man did on several occasions, conceal or connive at
concealing some of those slight errors and inadvertencies
that happen in the best regulated of banks. Wrong
Number was an enigma, an increasing mystery, nor was
he without his enjoyment of his associates’ mystification.</p>

<p>Wrong Number’s past, though veiled in mist in the
White River National, may here be fully and truthfully
disclosed. To understand Wrong Number one
must also understand Mr. Webster G. Burgess, his
discoverer and patron. In addition to being an astute
and successful banker, Mr. Burgess owned a string of
horses and sent them over various circuits at the usual
seasons, and he owned a stock farm of high repute as
may be learned by reference to any of the authoritative
stud books. If his discreet connection with the racetrack
encouraged the belief that Mr. Burgess was what
is vulgarly termed a “sport,” his prize-winning short-horns
in conjunction with his generous philanthropies
did much to minimize the sin of the racing stable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Mr. Burgess “took care of his customers,” a heavenly
attribute in any banker, and did not harass them unnecessarily.
Other bankers in town who passed the
plate every Sunday in church and knew nothing of
Horse might be suspicious and nervous and even disagreeable
in a pinch, but Mr. Burgess’s many admirers
believed that he derived from his association with
Horse a breadth of vision and an optimism peculiarly
grateful to that considerable number of merchants and
manufacturers who appreciate a liberal line of credit.
Mr. Burgess was sparing of language and his “Yes”
and “No” were equally pointed and final. Some of
his utterances, such as a warning to the hand-shaking
Vice president, “Don’t bring any anemic people into
my office,” were widely quoted in business circles.
“This is a bank, not the sheriff’s office,” he remarked
to a customer who was turning a sharp corner. “I’ve
told the boys to renew your notes. Quit sobbing and
get back on your job.”</p>

<p>It was by reason of their devotion to Horse that
Burgess and Wrong Number met and knew instantly
that the fates had ordained the meeting. Wrong Number
had grown up in the equine atmosphere of Lexington—the
Lexington of the Blue Grass, and his knowledge
of the rest of the world was gained from his
journeys to race meets with specimens of the horse
kind. Actors are not more superstitious than horsemen
and from the time he became a volunteer assistant
to the stablemen on the big horse farm the superstition
gained ground among the <i>cognoscenti</i> that the wings of
the Angel of Good Luck had brushed his tow head and
that he was a mascot of superior endowment. As he
transferred his allegiance from one stable to another
luck followed him, and when he picked, one year, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Derby winner the unlikeliest horse on the card and
that horse galloped home an easy winner, weird and
uncanny powers were attributed to Wrong Number.</p>

<p>Burgess had found him sitting on an upturned pail
in front of the stable that housed “Lord Templeton”
at six o’clock of the morning of the day the stallion
strode away from a brilliant field and won an enviable
prestige for the Burgess stables. Inspired by Wrong
Number’s confidence, Burgess had backed “Lord Templeton”
far more heavily than he had intended and as
a result was enabled to credit a small fortune to his
horse account. For four seasons the boy followed
the Burgess string and in winter made himself useful
on the Burgess farm somewhere north of the Ohio.
He showed a genius for acquiring information and was
cautious in expressing opinions; he was industrious in
an unobtrusive fashion; and he knew about all there
is to know about the care and training of horses. Being
a prophet he saw the beginning of the end of the
Horse Age and sniffed gasoline without resentment,
and could take an automobile to pieces and put it
together again. Burgess was his ideal of a gentleman,
a banker, and a horseman, and he carried his idolatry
to the point of imitating his benefactor in manner,
dress and speech. Finding that Wrong Number was
going into town for a night course in a business college,
Burgess paid the bill, and seeing that Wrong
Number at twenty-two had outgrown Horse and aspired
to a career in finance, Burgess took him into the bank
with an injunction to the cashier to “turn him loose
in the lot.”</p>

<p>While Mrs. Burgess enjoyed the excitement and
flutter of grandstands, her sense of humor was unequal
to a full appreciation of the social charm of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
gentlemen who live in close proximity to Horse. Their
ways and their manners and their dialect did not in
fact amuse her, and she entertained an utterly unwarranted
suspicion that they were not respectable. It
was with the gravest doubts and misgivings that she
witnessed the rise of Wrong Number who, after that
young gentleman’s transfer to the bank, turned up in
the Burgess town house rather frequently and had
even adorned her table.</p>

<p>On an occasion Web had wired her from Chicago
that he couldn’t get home for a certain charity concert
which she had initiated and suggested that she commandeer
Wrong Number as an escort; and as no other
man of her acquaintance was able or willing to represent
the shirking Webster, she did in fact utilize Wrong
Number. She was obliged to confess that he had
been of the greatest assistance to her and that but for
his prompt and vigorous action the programmes, which
had not been delivered at the music hall, would never
have been recovered from the theatre to which an
erring messenger had carried them. Wrong Number,
arrayed in evening dress, had handed her in and out
of her box and made himself agreeable to three other
wives of tired business men who loathed concerts and
pleaded important business engagements whenever
their peace was menaced by classical music. Mrs.
Burgess’s bitterness toward Webster for his unaccountable
interest in Wrong Number was abated somewhat
by these circumstances though she concealed the fact
and berated him for his desertion in an hour of need.</p>

<p>Webster G. Burgess was enormously entertained by
his wife’s social and philanthropic enterprises and he
was proud of her ability to manage things. Their two
children were away at school and at such times as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
they dined alone at home the table was the freest
confessional for her activities. She never understood
why Webster evinced so much greater interest and
pleasure in her reports of the warring factions than in
affairs that moved smoothly under her supreme direction.</p>

<p>“You know, Web,” she began on an evening during
the progress of the Great War, after watching her
spouse thrust his fork with satisfaction into a pudding
she had always found successful in winning him to an
amiable mood; “you know, Web, that Mrs. Gurley
hasn’t the slightest sense of fitness,—no tact,—no
delicacy!”</p>

<p>“You’ve hinted as much before,” said Webster placidly.
“Cleaned you up in a club election?”</p>

<p>“Web!” ejaculated Mrs. Burgess disdainfully. “You
know perfectly well she was completely snowed under
at the Women’s Civic League election. Do you think
after all I did to start that movement I’d let such a
woman take the presidency away from me? It isn’t
that I <i>cared</i> for it; heaven knows I’ve got enough to
do without that!”</p>

<p>“Right!” affirmed Burgess readily. “But what’s
she put over on you now?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess lifted her head quickly from a scrutiny
of the percolator flame.</p>

<p>“Put over! Don’t you think I give her any chance
to put anything over! I wouldn’t have her <i>think</i> for
a minute that she was in any sense a <i>rival</i>.”</p>

<p>“No; nothing vulgar and common like that,” agreed
Webster.</p>

<p>“But that woman’s got the idea that she’s going to
entertain all the distinguished people that come here.
And the Gurleys have only been here two years and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
we’ve lived here all our lives! It’s nothing to me, of
course, but you know there <i>is</i> a certain dignity in being
an old family, even here, and my great grandfather
was a pioneer governor, and yours was the first State
treasurer and that ought to count and always <i>has</i>
counted. And the Gurleys made all their money out
of tomatoes and pickles in a few years; and since they
came to town they’ve just been <i>forcing</i> themselves
everywhere.”</p>

<p>“I’d hardly say that,” commented Burgess. “There’s
no stone wall around this town. I was on a committee
of the Chamber of Commerce that invited Gurley to
move his canning factory here.”</p>

<p>“And after that he was brazen enough to take his
account to the Citizen’s!” exclaimed Mrs. Burgess.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t altogether Gurley’s fault, Gertie,” replied
Burgess, softly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean, Web——”</p>

<p>“I mean that we could have had his account if we’d
wanted it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad we’re under no obligations to carry
them round.”</p>

<p>“We’re not, if that’s the way you see it. But Mrs.
Gurley wears pretty good clothes,” he suggested, meditatively
removing the wrapper from his cigar.</p>

<p>“Webster Burgess, you don’t <i>mean</i>——”</p>

<p>“I mean that she’s smartly set up. You’ve got to
hand it to her, particularly for hats.”</p>

<p>“You never see what I wear! You haven’t paid the
slightest attention to anything I’ve worn for ten years!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself! That woman
buys all her clothes in New York, every stitch and
feather, and they cost five times what I spend! With
the war going on, I don’t feel that it’s <i>right</i> for a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
to spread herself on clothes. You know you said yourself
we ought to economize, and I discharged Marie
and cut down the household bills. Marie was worth
the fifty dollars a month I paid her for the cleaner’s
bills she saved me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burgess was at all times difficult to tease, and
Webster was conscious that he had erred grievously in
broaching the matter of Mrs. Gurley’s apparel, which
had never interested him a particle. He listened humbly
as Mrs. Burgess gave a detailed account of her
expenditures for raiment for several years, and revealed
what she had never meant to tell him, that out of her
personal allowance she was caring for eight French
orphans in addition to the dozen she had told him
about.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a mighty fine girl, Gertie. You know
I think so.”</p>

<p>The tears in Mrs. Burgess’s eyes made necessary some
more tangible expression of his affection than this, so
he walked round and kissed her, somewhat to the consternation
of the butler who at that moment appeared to clear the table.</p>

<p>“As to money,” he continued when they had reached
the living-room, “I got rid of some stock I thought was
a dead one the other day and I meant to give you a
couple of thousand. You may consider it’s yours for
clothes or orphans or anything you like.”</p>

<p>She murmured her gratitude as she took up her
knitting but he saw that the wound caused by his
ungallant reference to Mrs. Gurley’s wardrobe had not
been healed by a kiss and two thousand dollars. Gertrude
Burgess was a past mistress of the art of
extracting from any such situation its fullest potentialities
of compensation. And Webster knew as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
he fumbled the evening newspaper that before he
departed for the meeting of the War Chest Committee
that demanded his presence downtown at eight o’clock
he must make it easy for her to pour out her latest
grievances against Mrs. Gurley. He is a poor husband
who hasn’t learned the value of the casual approach.
To all outward appearances he had forgotten Mrs.
Gurley and for that matter Mrs. Burgess as well when,
without looking up from the Government estimate of
the winter wheat acreage, he remarked with a perfectly-feigned
absent air:</p>

<p>“By-the-way, Gertie, you started to say something
about that Gurley woman. Been breaking into your
fences somewhere?”</p>

<p>“If I thought you would be interested, Web——”</p>

<p>This on both sides was mere routine, a part of the
accepted method, the established technique of mollification.</p>

<p>“Of course I want to hear it,” said Webster, throwing
the paper down and planting himself at ease before her
with his back to the fire.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to think me unkind or unjust,
Web, but there are <i>some</i> things, you know!”</p>

<p>He admitted encouragingly that there were indeed
some things and bade her go on.</p>

<p>“Well, what made me very indignant was the way
that woman walked off with the Italian countess who
was here last week to speak to our Red Cross workers.
You know I wired Senator Saybrook to extend an invitation
to the Countess to come to our house, and he
wrote me that he had called on her at the Italian
Embassy and she had accepted; and then when the
Countess came and I went to the station to meet her,
Mrs. Gurley was there all dressed up and carried her off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
to her house. For sheer impudence, Web, that beat
anything I ever heard of. Every one <i>knows</i> our home
is always open and it had been in the papers that we
were to entertain the Countess Paretti. It was not only
a reflection on me, Web, but on you as well. And of
course the poor Countess wasn’t to blame, with all the
hurry and confusion at the station, and she didn’t
know me from Adam; and Mrs. Gurley simply captured
her—it was really a case of the most shameless kidnapping—and
hurried her into her limousine and took
her right off to her house.”</p>

<p>“Well, after the time you’d spent thinking up Italian
dishes for the lady to consume, I should say that the
spaghetti was on us,” said Burgess, recalling with relief
that the Countess’ failure to honor his home had
released him for dinner with a British aviator who had
proved to be a very amusing and interesting person.
“I meant to ask you how the Gurleys got into the
sketch. It was a contemptible thing to do, all right.
No wonder you’re bitter about it. I’ll cheerfully punch
Gurley’s head if that’ll do any good.”</p>

<p>“What I’ve been thinking about, Web, is this,”
said Mrs. Burgess, meditatively. “You know there’s an
Illyrian delegation coming to town, a special envoy of
some of the highest civil and military officials of poor
war-swept Illyria. And I heard this afternoon that
the Gurleys mean to carry them all to their house for
luncheon when the train arrives Thursday at noon just
before Governor Eastman receives them at the statehouse,
where there’s to be a big public meeting. The
Gurleys have had their old congressman from Taylorville
extend the invitation in Washington and of course
the Illyrians wouldn’t <i>know</i>, Web.”</p>

<p>“They would not,” said Webster. “The fame of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
domestic cuisine probably hasn’t reached Illyria and
the delegation would be sure to form a low opinion of
Western victualing if they feed at the Gurleys. The
Gurleys probably think it a chance to open up a new
market for their well-known Eureka brand of catsup in
Illyria after the war.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd!” admonished Mrs. Burgess.</p>

<p>“I’m not absurd; I’m indignant,” Webster averred.
“Put your cards on the table and let’s have a look.
What you want to do, Gertie, is to hand the Gurleys one
of their own sour pickles. I sympathize fully with your
ambition to retaliate. I’ll go further than that,”
he added with a covert glance at the clock; “I’ll see
what I can do to turn the trick!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see <i>how</i> it can be done without doing something
we can’t stoop to do,” replied Mrs. Burgess with
a hopeful quaver in her voice.</p>

<p>“We must do no stooping,” Webster agreed heartily.
“It would be far from us to resort to the coarse kidnapping
tactics of the Gurleys. And of course you
can’t go to the mat with Mrs. Gurley in the trainshed.
A rough and tumble scrap right there before the Illyrians
would be undignified and give ’em a quaint notion
of the social habits of the corn belt. But gently and
firmly to guide the Illyrian commissioners to our humble
home, throw them a luncheon, show ’em the family
album and after the show at the statehouse give ’em
a whirl to the art institute, and walk ’em through the
Illyrian relief rooms, where a pretty little Illyrian girl
dressed in her native costume would hand ’em flowers—that’s
the ticket.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Web, you are always so helpful when you want
to be! That’s the most beautiful idea about the flowers.
And perhaps a <i>group</i> of Illyrian children would do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
some folk dances! I’m sure the visitors would be
deeply touched by that.”</p>

<p>“It would certainly make a hit,” said Webster,
feeling that he was once more rehabilitated in his wife’s
affections and confidence. “You say the Gurleys’
publicity agent has already gazetted their hospitable
designs? Excellent! The more advance work they
do on the job the better. We’ll give a jar to the
pickles—that’s the game! Did you get that, Gertie?
Pickles, a jar of pickles; a jar to the pickle industry?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” said Mrs. Burgess, with a far-away
look in her eyes, “how charming the folk dances would
be and I must see the settlement house superintendent
about choosing just the <i>right</i> children. But, Web,
is it <i>possible</i> to do this so <i>no one</i> will know?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” he assured her. “Arrange
your luncheon and do it right. I’ve heard somewhere
that a great delicacy in Illyria is broiled grasshoppers,
or maybe it’s centipedes. Better look that
up to be sure not to poison our faithful ally. You’d
better whisper to Mrs. Eastman that you’ll want the
Governor, but tell her it’s to meet a prison reformer or
a Congo missionary; Eastman is keen on those lines.
And ask a few pretty girls and look up the Illyrian religion
and get a bishop to suit.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t told me how you <i>mean</i> to do it,
Web. Of course we must be careful——”</p>

<p>“Careful!” repeated Burgess shaking himself into
his top coat in the hall door. “My name is discretion.
You needn’t worry about that part of it! The whole
business will be taken care of; dead or alive you shall
have the Illyrians.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Wrong Number, locked up in the directors’ room of
the White River National, studied timetables and maps
and newspaper clippings bearing upon the Western
pilgrimage of the Illyrian Commission. In fifty words
Webster G. Burgess had transferred to his shoulders
full responsibility for producing the Illyrians in the
Burgess home, warning him it must be done with all
dignity and circumspection.</p>

<p>“That’s for expenses,” said Burgess, handing him
a roll of bills. “This job isn’t a bank transaction—you
get me? It’s strictly a social event.”</p>

<p>Wrong Number betrayed no perturbation as the
president stated the case. Matters of delicacy had
been confided to him before by his patron—the study
of certain horses he thought of buying and wished
an honest report on, the cautious sherlocking of a
country-town customer who was flying higher than his
credit; the disposal of the stock of an automobile dealer
whose business had jumped ahead of his capital;—such
tasks as these Wrong Number had performed to
the entire satisfaction of his employer.</p>

<p>In a new fall suit built by Burgess’s tailor, with a
green stripe instead of a blue to differentiate it from the
president’s latest, and with a white carnation in his
lapel (Mrs. Burgess provided a pink one for Web every
morning), Wrong Number brooded over this new
problem for two days before he became a man of action.</p>

<p>His broad democracy made him a familiar visitor to
cigar stands, billiard parlors, gun stores, soft drink bars
and cheap hotels where one encounters horsemen,
expert trap shooters, pugilists, book-makers, and other
agreeable characters never met in fashionable clubs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
After much thought he chose as his co-conspirator,
Peterson, a big Swede, to whom he had advanced money
with which to open a Turkish bath. As the bath was
flourishing the Swede welcomed an opportunity to
express his gratitude to one he so greatly admired;
and besides he still owed Wrong Number two hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>“I want a coupla guys that will look right in tall
hats,” said Wrong Number. “You’ll do for one; you’ll
make up fine for the Illyrian Minister of Foreign Affairs,—he’s
a tall chap, you’ll see from that picture of the
bunch being received at the New York city hall. Then
you want a little weazened cuss who won’t look like
an undertaker in a frock coat to stand for the Minister
of Finance. We need four more to complete the string
and they gotta have uniforms. Comic opera hats with
feathers—you can’t make ’em too fancy.”</p>

<p>The Swede nodded. The Uniform Rank of the Order
of the Golden Buck of which he was a prominent member
could provide the very thing.</p>

<p>“And I gotta have one real Illyrian to spout the
language to the delegation.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Bensaris who runs a candy
shop near where I live? He’s the big squeeze among
’em.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go down and see him. Remember, he don’t
need to know anything; just do what I tell him. There’s
a hundred in this for you, Pete, if you pull it right;
expenses extra.”</p>

<p>“The cops might pinch us,” suggested Peterson,
warily. “And what you goin’ to do about the Mayor?
It says in the papers that the Mayor meets the outfit
at the Union Station.”</p>

<p>“If the cops ask the countersign tell ’em you turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
out to meet the remains of a deceased brother. And
don’t worry about the Mayor. He’s been over the
Grand Circuit with me and brought his money home
in a trunk.”</p>

<p>He drew a memorandum book from his pocket and
set down the following items:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>Pete. 2 silk hats; five uni.<br />
Band.<br />
Bensaris.<br />
Mayor.<br />
5 touring cars.</p>
</div></div>

<p>“The honor, it is too much!” pleaded Bensaris when
Wrong Number and Peterson told him all it was
necessary for him to know, at a little table in the rear
of his shop. “But in the day’s paper my daughter read
me their excellencies be met at the Union Station;
the arrange’ have been change’?”</p>

<p>“The papers are never right,” declared Wrong Number.
“And you don’t need to tell ’em anything.”</p>

<p>“A lady, Mees Burgett, she came here to arrange all
Illyrians go to Relief office to sing the songs of my
country. My daughter, she shall dance and hand
flowers to their excellencies!” cried Bensaris beaming.</p>

<p>“The Bensaris family will be featured right through
the bill,” said Wrong Number.</p>

<p>“It is too kind,” insisted Bensaris. “It is for the
Mayor you make the arrange’?”</p>

<p>“I represent the financial interests of our city,”
Wrong Number replied. “You want to go the limit
in dressing up the automobiles; make ’em look like
Fourth o’ July in your native O’Learyo. Where do
we doll ’em up, Pete?”</p>

<p>A garage of a friend in the next block would serve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
admirably and Peterson promised to co-operate with
Bensaris in doing the job properly.</p>

<p>“Tail coat and two-gallon hat for Mr. Bensaris,”
said Wrong Number. “Pete, you look after that.”
He pressed cash upon Mr. Bensaris and noted the
amount in his book. “We’ll call it a heat,” he said,
and went uptown to pilot Mr. Webster G. Burgess
to a ten round match for points between two local
amateurs that was being pulled off behind closed doors
in an abandoned skating rink.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The Illyrian Commission had just breakfasted when
their train reached Farrington on the State line, where
the Mayor of the capital city, Mr. Clarence E. Tibbotts,
<i>alias</i> Wrong Number, and Mr. Zoloff Bensaris, all in
shining hats, boarded the train.</p>

<p>Having studied the portraits of the distinguished
Illyrians in a Sunday supplement provided by Mr.
Tibbotts, Mr. Bensaris effected the introductions without
an error, and having been carefully coached by
the same guide he did not handle his two-gallon hat
as though it were a tray of chocolate sundaes. The
kindness of the mayor and his associates in coming so
far to meet the Commission deeply touched the visitors.
The Fourth Assistant Secretary of State, who was doing
the honors of the American government, heard without
emotion of the slight changes in the programme.</p>

<p>“We thought the Commission would be tired of the
train,” explained Wrong Number, who was relieved to
find that his cutaway was of the same vintage as the
Fourth Assistant Secretary’s; “so we get off at the
first stop this side of town and motor in.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Luncheon at Mr. Gurley’s,” said the Secretary,
consulting a sheaf of telegrams.</p>

<p>“Had to change that, too,” said Wrong Number
carelessly; “they have scarlet fever at the Gurleys.
The Webster G. Burgesses will throw the luncheon.”</p>

<p>The Secretary made a note of the change and thrust
his papers into his pocket. Mr. Tibbotts handed
round his cigarette case, a silver trinket bearing “Lord
Templeton’s” head in enamel relief, a Christmas gift
from Mr. Webster G. Burgess, and joined in a discussion
of the morning’s news from the Balkans, where
the Illyrian troops were acquitting themselves with the
highest credit.</p>

<p>When the suburban villas of Ravenswood began to
dance along the windows, Mr. Tibbotts marshaled his
party and as they stepped from the private car a band
struck up the Illyrian national hymn. Several dozen
students from the nearby college who chanced to be
at the station raised a cheer. As the Illyrians were
piloted across the platform to the fleet of waiting automobiles,
the spectators were interested in the movements
of another party,—a party fully as distinguished
in appearance—that emerged from the station and
tripped briskly into a sleeper farther along in the train
that had discharged the Illyrians. Here, too, were
silk hats upon two sober-looking gentlemen who could
hardly be other than statesmen, and uniforms of great
splendor upon five stalwart forms, with topping plumes
waving blithely in the autumn air. And out of the
corner of his eye Mr. Clarence E. Tibbotts, just seating
himself in a big touring car, between the Fourth
Assistant Secretary of State and the Illyrian Minister
of Finance, saw Peterson’s work, and knew that it
was good.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>The procession swept into town at a lively clip, set
by the driver of the first car, that bore the Mayor
and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, which was driven
by a victor of many motor speed trials carefully chosen
by Wrong Number for this important service. The
piquant flavor of Wrong Number’s language as he
pointed out objects of interest amused the American
Secretary, much bored in his pilgrimages by the solemnities
of reception committees, and it served also to
convince the Illyrian Minister of Finance of the inadequacy
of his own English.</p>

<p>Lusty cheering greeted the party as it moved slowly
through the business district. When the Illyrian Minister
and the Fourth Secretary lifted their hats Wrong
Number kept time with them; he enjoyed lifting his
hat. He enjoyed also a view of half a dozen clerks on
the steps of the White River National, who cheered
deliriously as they espied their associate and hastened
within to spread the news of his latest exploit through
the cages.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that Mr. Tibbotts had taken the
precaution to plant a motion-picture camera opposite
the Burgess home, for otherwise the historical student
of the future might be puzzled to find that the first
edition of the <i>Evening Journal</i> of that day showed the
Illyrian delegation passing through the gates of the
Union Station, with a glimpse of Mrs. Arnold D.
Gurley handing a large bouquet of roses to a tall
gentleman who was not in fact the Illyrian Minister
of Foreign Affairs but the proprietor of Peterson’s bath
parlors. The <i>Journal</i> suppressed its pictures in later
editions, thereby saving its face, and printed without
illustrations an excellent account of the reception of
the Illyrians at Ravenswood and of the luncheon, from
facts furnished by Mr. Tibbotts, who stood guard at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
the door of the Burgess home while the function was
in progress in the dining room.</p>

<p>Who ate Mrs. Gurley’s luncheon is a moot question
in the select circles of the capital city. Peterson and
his party might have enjoyed the repast had not the
proprietor of the bath parlors, after accepting Mrs.
Gurley’s bouquet at the station gates, vanished with
his accomplices in the general direction of their lodge
room of the Order of the Golden Buck.</p>

<p>When foolish reporters tried to learn at the City
Hall why the Mayor had changed without warning
the plans for the reception, that official referred them
to the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, who
in turn directed the inquirers to the Governor’s office
and the Governor, having been properly admonished
by his wife, knew nothing whatever about it.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>As the Burgesses were reviewing the incidents of the
day at dinner that evening, Mrs. Burgess remarked
suddenly,</p>

<p>“Now that it’s all over, Web, do you think it was
quite fair, really <i>right</i>?”</p>

<p>“You mean,” asked Webster, huskily, “that you’re
not satisfied with the way it was handled?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not that! But it was almost <i>too</i> complete; and
poor Mrs. Gurley must be horribly humiliated.”</p>

<p>“Crushed, I should say,” remarked Webster cheerfully.
“This ought to hold her for a while.”</p>

<p>“But that fake delegation you had at the station to
deceive Mrs. Gurley——”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” Webster interrupted, “I assure
you I had nothing to do with it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Well, all I <i>know</i> is that just before dinner Mrs.
Eastman called me up and said the Governor had just
telephoned her that Mrs. Gurley tried to <i>kiss</i> the hand
of some man she took for the Illyrian Minister of
Foreign Affairs as he went through the station gates.
And the man is nothing but a rubber in a Turkish bath.
You <i>wouldn’t</i> have done that, Web, would you?”</p>

<p>“No, dear, I would not! For one thing, I wouldn’t
have been smart enough to think it up.”</p>

<p>“And you know, Web, I shouldn’t want you to think
me mean and envious and jealous. I’m not really that
way; you know I’m not! And of course if I’d thought
you’d really bring the Illyrians here, I should never
have mentioned it at all.”</p>

<p>Webster passed his hand across his brow in bewilderment.
At moments when he thought he was meeting
the most exacting requirements of the marital relationship
it was enormously disturbing to find himself
defeated.</p>

<p>“Your luncheon was a great success; the talk at the
table was wonderful; and the girls you brought in made
a big hit. It’s the best party you ever pulled off,” he
declared warmly.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think so,” she said slowly, giving him
her direct gaze across the table, “but there were one
or two things I didn’t quite like, Web. It seemed to
me your young friend Tibbotts was a little <i>too</i> conspicuous.
I’m surprised that you let him come to
the house. You couldn’t—you <i>wouldn’t</i> have let him
<i>know</i> how the Illyrians came here? He really seemed
to assume full charge of the party, and in the drawing
room he was flirting outrageously with pretty Lois
Hubbard, and kept her giggling when I’d asked her
<i>specially</i> to be nice to the Fourth Assistant Secretary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
who’s a bachelor, you know. And if Mrs. Hubbard
<i>knew</i> we had introduced Lois to a boy from the racetrack——”</p>

<p>“It would be awful,” said Webster with one of the
elusive grins that always baffled her.</p>

<p>“What would be awful?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing! I was thinking of Wrong Number
and what a blow it would be if I should lose him.
I must remember to raise his salary in the morning.”</p>
